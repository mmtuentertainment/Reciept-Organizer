# Executive Summary: Hybrid Cloud Migration
@poml:meta {
  type: "executive-summary"
  version: "1.0.0"
  created: "2025-01-11"
  audience: "Technical leadership, Development team"
}

## Migration Overview
@poml:summary {
  current_state: "Offline-first Flutter app with 131 failing tests"
  target_state: "Hybrid cloud architecture with Supabase backend"
  duration: "17 days"
  risk_level: "Medium with mitigation strategies"
  investment: "2 developers, 1 QA, 1 DevOps"
}

## Business Case
@poml:business {
  
  @problem {
    test_failures: 131
    root_cause: "path_provider MissingPluginException in tests"
    impact: "Cannot validate code changes, blocked deployment"
    limitation: "Single device only, no cloud backup"
  }
  
  @solution {
    approach: "Hybrid cloud with offline-first fallback"
    technology: "Supabase + Vercel + Flutter"
    benefits: [
      "Cross-device synchronization",
      "Cloud backup and recovery",
      "Collaborative features",
      "100% testable codebase"
    ]
  }
  
  @roi {
    immediate: "Unblock development with passing tests"
    short_term: "Enable cloud features for users"
    long_term: "Platform for scaling and collaboration"
  }
}

## Technical Approach
@poml:technical {
  
  @strategy {
    pattern: "Repository pattern with strategy"
    testing: "Mock-first without file system"
    sync: "Queue-based eventual consistency"
    deployment: "Feature flags with canary rollout"
  }
  
  @phases {
    foundation: "Days 1-2: Create abstraction layer"
    backend: "Days 3-4: Setup Supabase"
    implementation: "Days 5-10: Dual-write and sync"
    testing: "Days 7-8: Fix all 131 tests"
    deployment: "Days 11-17: Rollout with monitoring"
  }
}

## Risk Assessment
@poml:risks {
  
  @identified_risks {
    data_loss: {
      probability: "Low"
      impact: "High"
      mitigation: "Backups, checksums, validation"
    }
    
    performance: {
      probability: "Low"
      impact: "High"
      mitigation: "Caching, monitoring, rollback"
    }
    
    user_disruption: {
      probability: "Low"
      impact: "High"
      mitigation: "Feature flags, canary deployment"
    }
  }
  
  @rollback {
    trigger_conditions: [
      "Error rate > 1%",
      "P95 latency > 500ms",
      "Sync failures > 5%"
    ]
    time_to_rollback: "< 5 minutes"
    mechanism: "Feature flags disable"
  }
}

## Success Criteria
@poml:success {
  
  @technical {
    tests: "571/571 passing (100%)"
    coverage: "> 95%"
    performance: "< 200ms API response"
    reliability: "> 99.9% uptime"
  }
  
  @business {
    adoption: "> 80% users enable sync"
    satisfaction: "> 4.5/5 rating"
    support: "< 1% ticket rate"
    retention: "No decrease"
  }
  
  @operational {
    deployment: "< 30 minutes"
    rollback: "< 5 minutes"
    recovery: "< 1 hour MTTR"
  }
}

## Decision Record
@poml:decisions {
  
  @why_hybrid {
    reason: "Best of both worlds"
    benefits: [
      "Works offline like current app",
      "Syncs when online for backup",
      "No user disruption",
      "Gradual migration possible"
    ]
  }
  
  @why_supabase {
    reason: "Optimal for mobile apps"
    benefits: [
      "Built-in auth and RLS",
      "Realtime subscriptions",
      "PostgreSQL reliability",
      "Excellent Flutter SDK"
    ]
  }
  
  @why_mock_first {
    reason: "Eliminate test failures"
    benefits: [
      "No file system dependencies",
      "Fast test execution",
      "Predictable test data",
      "Works in CI/CD"
    ]
