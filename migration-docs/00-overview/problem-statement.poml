@poml:meta {
  type: "problem-analysis"
  version: "1.0.0"
  created: "2025-01-11"
  severity: "Critical - Blocks deployment"
}

## The Problem
@poml:problem {
  
  @symptoms {
    test_results: "440 passing, 131 failing"
    failure_rate: "23% of test suite"
    error_type: "MissingPluginException"
    error_source: "path_provider package"
    
    @example_error {
      message: "MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method getApplicationDocumentsDirectory)"
      location: "preview_initialization_provider.dart:85"
      cause: "await imageStorage.saveTemporary(params.imageData)"
    }
  }
  
  @root_cause {
    primary: "Offline-first architecture requires file system access"
    secondary: "path_provider doesn't work in test environment"
    impact: "Cannot test any code that saves/loads files"
    
    @technical_details {
      package: "path_provider"
      issue: "Requires platform channel implementation"
      test_env: "No platform channels in unit tests"
      result: "Tests fail when accessing file system"
    }
  }
}

## Failed Test Categories
@poml:test_failures {
  
  @preview_screen {
    count: 15
    issue: "Image storage to file system"
    example: "preview_screen_test.dart"
    failure: "Stuck in loading state"
  }
  
  @capture_flow {
    count: 22
    issue: "Saving captured images"
    example: "capture_retry_flow_test.dart"
    failure: "Cannot save to temp directory"
  }
  
  @export_features {
    count: 18
    issue: "CSV file generation"
    example: "batch_capture_flow_test.dart"
    failure: "Cannot write export files"
  }
  
  @receipt_management {
    count: 31
    issue: "Image loading from storage"
    example: "receipt_details_test.dart"
    failure: "Cannot load receipt images"
  }
  
  @integration_tests {
    count: 45
    issue: "End-to-end workflows"
    example: "full_capture_workflow_test.dart"
    failure: "Multiple file system touches"
  }
}

## Why Tests Matter
@poml:importance {
  
  @development_velocity {
    current: "Blocked - cannot validate changes"
    impact: "No confidence in code modifications"
    risk: "Introducing bugs without detection"
  }
  
  @ci_cd_pipeline {
    current: "Red - failing builds"
    impact: "Cannot deploy to production"
    requirement: "Green builds for deployment"
  }
  
  @code_quality {
    current: "Degrading without tests"
    impact: "Technical debt accumulation"
    need: "Tests as specification"
  }
}

## Current Architecture Limitations
@poml:limitations {
  
  @offline_first_issues {
    storage: "Local file system only"
    testing: "Cannot mock file system"
    scalability: "Single device limitation"
    backup: "No cloud recovery"
  }
  
  @mobile_app_expectations {
    users_expect: [
      "Cloud backup of receipts",
      "Access from multiple devices",
      "Share receipts with accountant",
      "Recover after device loss"
    ]
    
    current_gap: [
      "No cloud storage",
      "No synchronization",
      "No sharing capability",
      "No recovery mechanism"
    ]
  }
}

## Discovery Process
@poml:discovery {
  
  @initial_observation {
    symptom: "Tests failing in CI/CD"
    investigation: "Local tests also fail"
    pattern: "All failures involve file I/O"
  }
  
  @root_cause_analysis {
    step1: "Identified MissingPluginException"
    step2: "Traced to path_provider calls"
    step3: "Confirmed platform channel issue"
    step4: "Validated with Flutter documentation"
  }
  
  @solution_exploration {
    option1: {
      approach: "Mock platform channels"
      result: "Complex, brittle, maintenance burden"
      decision: "Rejected"
    }
    
    option2: {
      approach: "Integration tests only"
      result: "Slow, requires devices/emulators"
      decision: "Rejected"
    }
    
    option3: {
      approach: "Abstract file system, use mocks"
      result: "Clean, testable, maintainable"
      decision: "Accepted"
    }
  }
}

## Impact Analysis
@poml:impact {
  
  @immediate {
    development: "Blocked feature development"
    testing: "Cannot validate code"
    deployment: "Cannot release updates"
  }
  
  @ongoing {
    quality: "Accumulating untested code"
    risk: "Hidden bugs in production"
    morale: "Developer frustration"
  }
  
  @future {
    scalability: "Cannot add cloud features"
    competition: "Falling behind competitors"
    users: "Missing expected features"
  }

## Solution Requirements
@poml:requirements {
  
  @must_have {
    tests: "All 571 tests must pass"
    offline: "Maintain offline capability"
    data: "No data loss during migration"
    users: "Zero disruption to users"
  }
  
  @should_have {
    cloud: "Add cloud synchronization"
    backup: "Automatic cloud backup"
    devices: "Multi-device support"
    sharing: "Receipt sharing capability"
  }
  
  @nice_to_have {
    realtime: "Live collaboration"
    analytics: "Usage insights"
    ml: "Smart categorization"
  }
}

## Key Insight
@poml:insight {
  realization: "Tests define the specification"
  principle: "Tests aren't made to fit code, code is made to fit tests"
  implication: "Architecture must change to support testing"
  
  @paradigm_shift {
    from: "Offline-first with local files"
    to: "Hybrid cloud with local cache"
    benefit: "Best of both worlds"
  }
