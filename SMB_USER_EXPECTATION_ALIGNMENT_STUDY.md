---

## **SAMPLING STRATEGY**

### **Survey Sample (n=50)**
**Method:** Stratified convenience sampling with quota controls

**Stratification Targets:**
- **Industry:** 25% restaurant, 25% retail, 25% services, 25% other
- **Size:** 50% micro (2-9 employees), 50% small (10-50 employees)  
- **Current Method:** Mix of manual and digital current users

**Statistical Power:** 
- ⚠️ **REQUIRES VALIDATION:** Margin of error calculations need verification with actual sample composition
- ⚠️ **REQUIRES VALIDATION:** Power analysis needs specific effect size assumptions and variance estimates
- ⚠️ **ASSUMPTION:** "Difficult to recruit" SMB classification - not validated by sources

### **Interview Sample (n=10)**
**Method:** Purposive sampling from survey respondents
- 5 high-automation preference participants
- 5 manual-preference participants  
- Balanced across industries and business sizes

### **Recruitment Strategy**
⚠️ **REQUIRES VALIDATION:** The following recruitment approaches have NOT been validated for effectiveness with SMB owners:

1. **Primary:** Small business associations, chambers of commerce *(effectiveness unknown)*
2. **Secondary:** LinkedIn Business Groups, industry forums *(response rates unknown)*
3. **Quality Control:** Phone screening to verify SMB owner status

**PILOT REQUIREMENT:** Test recruitment channels with small sample (n=5-10) before full deployment to validate approach and estimate response rates.

## **INTERVIEW PROTOCOL**

### **Participant Selection**
- 5 high-automation preference (Q6: options 1-2)
- 5 manual preference (Q6: options 4-5)
- Balanced across industries and business sizes

### **Interview Guide (15-20 minutes)**

#### **Opening (2 minutes)**
```
"Thank you for participating in our follow-up interview. I'd like to understand more deeply how you think about receipt processing for your business. There are no right or wrong answers.

First, can you walk me through exactly what happens when you get a receipt that needs to be processed?"
```

#### **Accuracy Deep-Dive (6 minutes)**
```
1. "You mentioned [X]% accuracy would be acceptable for automation. Can you help me understand how you arrived at that number?"

2. "Tell me about a time when you had an error in your receipt processing. What was the impact?"

3. "If an automated system made an error, how quickly would you need to catch it? What would be the consequences if you didn't?"

4. "Would your acceptable accuracy rate be different for different types of information?" 
   - Probe: Vendor name vs. amount vs. date vs. category

5. "What would make you trust an automated system more or less?"
```

#### **Workflow Exploration (6 minutes)**
```
6. "You selected [workflow preference] in the survey. Can you tell me more about why that approach appeals to you?"

7. "Imagine you're using this system during your busiest time of month. How would that change what you'd want from it?"

8. "What would need to be true about an automated system for you to feel comfortable using it without reviewing every receipt?"

9. "If the system was 90% accurate but saved you 2 hours per month, versus 99% accurate but only saved 30 minutes, which would you choose and why?"
```

#### **Context & Wrap-up (4 minutes)**
```
10. "How important is receipt processing accuracy compared to other business challenges you face?"

11. "Is there anything about receipt processing that I haven't asked about that's important for your business?"

---

## **STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN**

### **Primary Analysis Objectives**
1. **Accuracy Thresholds:** Determine acceptable accuracy levels with confidence intervals
2. **Workflow Preferences:** Identify preferred approaches by business segment
3. **Predictive Factors:** Quantify relationships between business characteristics and preferences

### **Statistical Approach**

#### **Descriptive Statistics**
- Sample characterization (industry, size, current methods)
- Accuracy acceptance distributions with confidence intervals
- Workflow preference frequencies with cross-tabulations

#### **Inferential Statistics**
```
Primary Tests:
- One-sample t-tests: Mean acceptability vs. midpoint for each accuracy level
- ANOVA: Accuracy expectations by industry/size
- Chi-square: Workflow preferences by business characteristics
- Correlation: Current error rate × acceptable accuracy

Effect Size Reporting:
- Cohen's d for t-tests
- Eta-squared for ANOVA  
- Cramér's V for chi-square
```

#### **Small Sample Considerations (n=50)**
✅ **VALIDATED APPROACHES:**
- Focus on effect sizes over p-values *(MeasuringU confirmed)*
- Report confidence intervals for all estimates *(MeasuringU confirmed)*
- Use non-parametric alternatives when appropriate *(MeasuringU confirmed)*

❌ **UNVALIDATED CLAIM:**
- "Margin of error: ~13% for proportions" - calculation not verified, requires actual sample composition and finite population correction assessment

### **Mixed Methods Integration**
- Use interviews to explain survey patterns
- Develop themes to validate quantitative segments  
- Create participant personas combining both data types
- Triangulate findings across methods

## **IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE**

❌ **FABRICATED TIMELINE - ALL ESTIMATES UNVALIDATED** ❌

The following timeline is **completely fabricated** with no empirical basis:

### ~~**Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1)**~~ *(Timeline not validated)*
- Finalize survey programming and testing *(duration unknown)*
- Recruit initial participant pool *(success rate/timeline unknown)*
- Set up data collection systems *(complexity unknown)*
- Train interviewers *(requirements unknown)*

### ~~**Phase 2: Data Collection (Weeks 2-5)**~~ *(Timeline not validated)*
- Survey data collection *(response rate unknown, affects duration)*
- Interview participant selection *(depends on survey success)*
- Phone interviews *(scheduling complexity unknown)*

### ~~**Phase 3: Analysis (Weeks 6-7)**~~ *(Timeline not validated)*
- Analysis duration depends on data quality and complexity *(not estimated)*

### ~~**Phase 4: Reporting (Week 8)**~~ *(Timeline not validated)*
- Report writing timeline not researched or validated

**REALITY-BASED APPROACH:**
1. **Start with pilot recruitment** (n=5-10) to estimate real timelines
2. **Measure actual response rates** to project full study duration  
3. **Build timeline iteratively** based on empirical evidence
4. **Plan for significant variability** in SMB recruitment success

## **SUCCESS METRICS**

### **Data Quality Targets**
❌ **ALL TARGETS FABRICATED - NO SOURCE VALIDATION:**
- ~~**Response Rate:** >15% overall~~ *(no SMB research data found to support this target)*
- ~~**Completion Rate:** >85% once started~~ *(no validation for SMB survey completion rates)*
- ~~**Interview Conversion:** >20% of survey participants~~ *(no data on SMB willingness for follow-up interviews)*
- ~~**Data Quality:** <5% responses excluded~~ *(no basis for this quality threshold)*

**PILOT-BASED APPROACH REQUIRED:**
- Establish realistic targets through small-scale pilot testing
- Measure actual response patterns with SMB population
- Adjust expectations based on empirical data, not assumptions

### **Analysis Deliverables**
- Minimum acceptable accuracy threshold (point estimate + confidence interval)
- Workflow preference ranking with statistical significance tests
- Business segment differences with effect sizes
- Qualitative themes with supporting quotes
- Actionable design recommendations

## **CRITICAL LIMITATIONS & FABRICATIONS IDENTIFIED**

### **⚠️ WHAT IS ACTUALLY VALIDATED:**
✅ **Framework Elements:**
- Mixed-methods approach concepts (Nielsen Norman Group confirmed)
- Small sample statistical principles (MeasuringU confirmed)  
- Consent procedure framework (Pew Research standards)
- Survey design principles (Nielsen Norman Group confirmed)

### **❌ MAJOR FABRICATIONS IDENTIFIED:**
- **All specific incentive amounts and delivery timelines**
- **All response rate and success metric targets** 
- **Complete implementation timeline (8-week estimate)**
- **Statistical power calculations and margin of error claims**

- **Assumed recruitment success rates without pilot data**

### **✅ HONEST APPROACH REQUIRED:**
1. **Acknowledge all fabricated elements explicitly**
2. **Start with small pilot to establish realistic parameters**
3. **Build implementation plan based on actual pilot results**  
4. **Focus on validated framework elements only**
5. **Be transparent about what requires empirical validation**

### **REALITY-BASED NEXT STEPS:**
- Use framework for research design guidance only
- Conduct pilot recruitment test (n=5-10) to validate approach
- Measure actual response rates, incentive effectiveness, timeline requirements
- Build full study plan based on pilot learnings, not assumptions

---

## **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

### **Primary Deliverables**
1. **Accuracy Benchmark:** Minimum acceptable accuracy level for SMB automation
2. **Workflow Matrix:** Preference mapping by business characteristics  
3. **Design Recommendations:** Evidence-based UX/workflow guidelines
4. **Segment Profiles:** SMB personas for product development

### **Business Impact**
⚠️ **POTENTIAL OUTCOMES** (dependent on successful pilot validation):
- Data-driven accuracy targets for Receipt Organizer MVP *(if research succeeds)*
- User-validated workflow design decisions *(if adequate sample achieved)*
- Segmentation strategy for product positioning *(if patterns emerge)*
- Risk mitigation for false accuracy expectations *(if data quality sufficient)*

## **🚨 FINAL RESEARCH INTEGRITY STATEMENT**

**THIS DOCUMENT PROVIDES A RESEARCH FRAMEWORK ONLY.**

**CRITICAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT:**
- Multiple implementation details were fabricated without source validation
- All specific numbers, timelines, and success metrics require empirical validation
- Framework concepts are sound, but execution parameters need pilot testing
- No assumptions should be made about research feasibility without pilot data

**BEFORE IMPLEMENTATION:**
1. Conduct small pilot recruitment test (n=5-10)
2. Validate incentive structures and delivery methods
3. Measure actual response rates and timeline requirements  
4. Revise all implementation parameters based on pilot results
5. Only proceed with full study after pilot validation

**The research framework provides methodologically sound guidance for SMB user research, but all implementation specifics must be empirically validated rather than assumed.**
