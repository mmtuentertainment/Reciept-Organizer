# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a **Receipt Organizer MVP** project for mom-and-pop businesses, providing offline-first receipt capture, OCR processing, and CSV export. The project has completed Flutter 3.35.3 migration and uses a simplified 15-test strategy.

## Project Architecture

### Core Requirements
- **Target Users**: Owner-operators, mom-and-pop businesses, solo bookkeepers managing 100-500 receipts/month
- **Offline-First**: All processing must work without network connectivity
- **Core Workflow**: Photo capture ‚Üí OCR extraction ‚Üí CSV export
- **Key Fields**: Merchant, Date, Total, Tax (4 fields only for MVP)

### Technical Stack (Implemented)
Based on architecture in `docs/sharded-architecture/tech-stack.md`:

- **Frontend**: Flutter 3.35.3 with Dart 3.2+
- **State Management**: Riverpod 2.4+
- **OCR Engine**: Google ML Kit (primary) + TensorFlow Lite (fallback)
- **Local Database**: SQLite via sqflite with RxDB reactive layer
- **Cloud Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase with RLS
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (anonymous + email/password)
- **Realtime Sync**: Supabase Realtime channels
- **Image Processing**: Flutter camera plugin with edge detection
- **CSV Generation**: Built-in Dart CSV library (RFC 4180 compliant with BOM)
- **Architecture**: Offline-first with progressive cloud enhancement

### Success Metrics
From `project_brief_mom_and_pop_receipt_organizer_mvp_v_1.md`:

- **Capture‚ÜíExtract latency**: ‚â§ 5s p95
- **Field accuracy**: Total ‚â• 95%, Date ‚â• 95%, Merchant ‚â• 90%, Tax ‚â• 85%
- **Zero-touch happy path**: ‚â• 70% require no edits
- **CSV export pass rate**: ‚â• 99% pass QuickBooks/Xero validators
- **Offline reliability**: Full functionality without network
- **Stability**: ‚â• 99.5% crash-free sessions

## Development Constraints

### What we WILL build (MVP Scope)
1. Smart edge detection with manual override
2. Confidence-based OCR with quick edit (4 fields only)
3. Basic vendor normalization
4. Pre-flight CSV validation with templates
5. Offline-first local storage
6. Batch capture and simple organizing aids

### What we will NOT build (v1)
- ~~Cloud accounts/multi-user sync~~ (NOW IMPLEMENTED via Supabase)
- Bank/ERP integrations (API stubs ready for future)
- Line-item extraction
- Complex approvals/workflows
- Heavy ML training
- Multi-device support beyond one Android and one iPhone

## Key Principles

1. **KISS/YAGNI/DIW**: Each change must be reversible, minimal, and measured
2. **Offline-First**: All functionality must work without internet
3. **Evidence-Based**: All technical decisions backed by research data
4. **CSV as Contract**: Publish schemas and validate pre-export
5. **Honest OCR UX**: Visible confidence scores + fast correction over perfect automation

## CRITICAL: Test Suite Management

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Simplified Test Strategy (15 Tests Only)
**DO NOT ADD MORE TESTS WITHOUT EXPLICIT DISCUSSION**

This project uses a **minimal test strategy** following the CleanArchitectureTodoApp pattern:
- **Original**: 571 tests (way too many, 131 failing)
- **Current**: 15 critical tests only
- **Location**: `apps/mobile/test/`
- **Strategy**: See `apps/mobile/test/SIMPLIFIED_TEST_STRATEGY.md`

#### Test Categories:
1. **Core Tests** (`test/core_tests/`) - Unit tests for business logic
   - Receipt repository operations
   - CSV export functionality
   - App launch verification

2. **Integration Tests** (`test/integration_tests/`) - User flow tests
   - Critical user flows
   - Navigation between screens
   - Settings access

3. **Export Validation** (`test/integration/export_validation_flow_test.dart`) - 13 tests
   - QuickBooks/Xero format validation
   - CSV injection prevention
   - Performance benchmarks

4. **Infrastructure Tests** (`test/infrastructure/`) - Cloud integration
   - Supabase auth service tests
   - Sync service tests
   - Integration tests (skipped when not configured)

### Why Only 15 Tests?
- Industry best practice: Most successful Flutter apps have 50-200 tests, not 500+
- CleanArchitectureTodoApp (a reference implementation) uses only 12 tests
- Maintenance burden of 571 tests was unsustainable
- Focus on critical business logic, not edge cases

### Before Adding ANY Test:
1. Read `apps/mobile/test/SIMPLIFIED_TEST_STRATEGY.md`
2. Justify why it's critical for MVP
3. Consider if existing tests already cover it
4. Get explicit approval in the conversation

flutter test test/core_tests/ test/integration_tests/  # Run ONLY the 15 critical tests
flutter run                                             # Run the app
flutter analyze --no-pub                                # Check for issues
flutter build apk --debug                               # Build Android APK

# API (from apps/api/)
npm run dev                                            # Start development server
npm run build                                          # Build for production
npm test                                               # Run API tests

# Supabase (from infrastructure/supabase/)
npx supabase start                                     # Start local Supabase
npx supabase stop                                      # Stop local Supabase
npx supabase status                                    # Check Supabase status
npx supabase db push                                   # Apply migrations
npx supabase db seed                                   # Seed test data

# Supabase Integration Tests
CI=true flutter test test/infrastructure/supabase_integration_test.dart

# Utility Scripts (from root)
bash apps/mobile/test/PROTECT_TESTS.sh                # Verify test count stays at ~15
```
## Important Reminders

### Test Discipline
- **NEVER** add tests without explicit discussion
- Run `PROTECT_TESTS.sh` to verify test count stays at ~15
- See `apps/mobile/test/SIMPLIFIED_TEST_STRATEGY.md` for rationale
- Use real data fixtures from `lib/test/fixtures/real_data_loader.dart`

### Code Quality
- All code changes must pass `flutter analyze`
- Tests must pass before any PR/merge
- Follow patterns in existing codebase

### Documentation
- Keep `PROJECT_STATUS.md` updated with progress
- Document significant decisions in appropriate docs/ section
- Update this file when project structure changes

## Supabase Infrastructure

### Local Development Setup
The project includes a fully configured Supabase setup for cloud features:

- **Local URL**: http://127.0.0.1:54321
- **Dashboard**: http://127.0.0.1:54323  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on port 54322
- **Migrations**: Located in `infrastructure/supabase/migrations/`

### Key Services Implemented
1. **SupabaseAuthService** (`lib/infrastructure/services/supabase_auth_service.dart`)
   - Anonymous authentication for quick start
   - Email/password registration and sign-in
   - Session management and token refresh
   - Implements IAuthService interface

2. **SupabaseSyncService** (`lib/infrastructure/services/supabase_sync_service.dart`)
   - Bidirectional data sync
   - Realtime subscriptions using channels
   - Conflict resolution (Last Write Wins + field merging)
   - Offline queue management
   - Implements ISyncService interface

### Database Schema
- `receipts` - Main receipt storage with user isolation via RLS
- `sync_metadata` - Track sync state per device
- `export_history` - CSV export audit trail
- `user_preferences` - User-specific settings

### Environment Configuration
The app uses standard Supabase local development credentials which are safe for local use:
```dart
// Environment.isDevelopment determines which config to use
const String _localDevUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:54321';
const String _localDevAnonKey = 'eyJhb...'; // Standard local dev key
```

For production, use environment variables:
```bash
flutter build apk \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co \
  --dart-define=SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
```
