## ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Use POML Version

This project uses **CLAUDE.poml** as the primary instruction file for Claude Code.

- **Primary File**: `CLAUDE.poml` - Contains all project instructions in structured POML format
- **When Updating**: Always update the CLAUDE.poml file, not this file
- **Location**: `/home/matt/FINAPP/Receipt Organizer/CLAUDE.poml`

The POML format provides better structure and parsing for AI assistants while maintaining all essential project guidance.
