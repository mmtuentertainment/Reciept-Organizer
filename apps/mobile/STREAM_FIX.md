# ✅ Stream Test Fixed

## Problem
The stream test was failing because:
```
Expected: [0, 1, 0]  // 0 items initially, 1 after create, 0 after delete
Actual:   [1, 0]     // Missing initial emission
```

## Root Cause
The `watchAll()` method returned a stream that **didn't emit the initial state**. It only emitted when `_notifyListeners()` was called after operations.

### Before (❌ No initial emission)
```dart
Stream<Result<List<ReceiptModel>, Failure>> watchAll() {
  return _streamController.stream.map((receipts) {
    // Only emits when _notifyListeners() is called
    return Result.success(receipts);
  });
}
```

### After (✅ Immediate initial emission)
```dart
Stream<Result<List<ReceiptModel>, Failure>> watchAll() {
  return Stream.multi((controller) {
    // 1. Emit current state immediately
    final currentReceipts = _store.values.toList();
    controller.add(Result.success(currentReceipts));

    // 2. Then listen for future changes
    final subscription = _streamController.stream.listen(
      (receipts) => controller.add(Result.success(receipts))
    );

    // 3. Cleanup on cancel
    controller.onCancel = () => subscription.cancel();
  });
}
```

## Key Changes
1. **Used `Stream.multi()`** - Creates a multi-subscription stream with custom logic
2. **Immediate emission** - Emits current state as soon as someone subscribes
3. **Continued listening** - Still receives all future updates
4. **Proper cleanup** - Cancels internal subscription when stream is cancelled

## Impact
- ✅ All 9/9 domain tests now pass
- ✅ Streams behave correctly (emit initial state + all updates)
- ✅ Better matches real-world reactive patterns
- ✅ Both `watchAll()` and `watchById()` fixed

## Test Results
```bash
$ flutter test test/domain_validation_test.dart
00:03 +9: All tests passed!
```

## Why This Matters
In real apps, when you subscribe to a stream (like watching receipts), you expect:
1. **Current state immediately** - Show existing data
2. **Live updates** - React to changes

The fix ensures both requirements are met, making the fake repository behave like a real reactive data source.
