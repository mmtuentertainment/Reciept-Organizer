# Cleanup Complete ✅

## Files Removed (Safe Cleanup)

### ✅ Removed Files (4 total)
1. `test/fixtures/receipt_fixtures.dart.backup` - Backup file
2. `test/mocks/async_receipt_mock.dart` - Duplicate async mock
3. `test/mocks/sync_receipt_provider.dart` - Duplicate sync provider
4. `test-results.log` - Temporary log file

### 📁 Remaining Clean Structure

```
test/mocks/ (3 files - no duplicates)
├── mock_image_capture_service.dart  ✅ Used
├── proper_async_receipt_mock.dart   ✅ Used by receipts_list_async_test
└── simple_sync_receipt_provider.dart ✅ Used by receipts_list_test

test/fixtures/ (2 files)
├── receipt_fixtures_simplified.dart ✅ New clean version
└── test_data_generator.dart        ✅ Used by quickbooks_api_validation_test
```

## ⚠️ Files NOT Removed (Need Migration First)

### Receipt Model Duplicates - KEEP FOR NOW
These files have 10+ dependencies and need proper migration:

1. **`/lib/core/models/receipt.dart`** (5 dependencies)
   - infrastructure/services/receipt_api_service.dart
   - infrastructure/services/mock_sync_service.dart
   - infrastructure/services/supabase_sync_service.dart
   - infrastructure/repositories/hybrid_receipt_repository.dart
   - domain/services/interfaces/i_sync_service.dart

2. **`/lib/data/models/receipt.dart`** (5 dependencies)
   - core/repositories/interfaces/i_receipt_repository.dart
   - database/app_database.dart
   - infrastructure/repositories/hybrid_receipt_repository.dart
   - domain/mappers/receipt_mapper.dart (for conversion)
   - domain/services/csv_export_service.dart

### Why Not Removed
- Active production dependencies
- Would break existing functionality
- Need planned migration to domain model

## Summary

### Before Cleanup
- 5 mock files (2 duplicates)
- 1 backup file
- 1 log file
- 3 Receipt model classes

### After Cleanup
- 3 mock files (no duplicates) ✅
- 0 backup files ✅
- 0 log files ✅
- 3 Receipt models (migration needed)

### Space Saved
- ~15KB from duplicate files
- Cleaner test structure
- No orphaned backups

## Next Steps (Future)

To complete cleanup:
1. Migrate all code to use `/lib/domain/models/receipt_model.dart`
2. Update all imports (10+ files)
3. Remove old Receipt classes
4. Save ~14KB more

**Current state is clean and safe!** No functionality broken.
