## üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY CORRECTIONS

### 6. Claude Code Capability Ratings

**‚ùå ADJUST THESE RATINGS:**
```
- Frontend (Flutter/Dart): 9.5/10
- Backend/Data: 9.0/10  
- Native Integrations: 8.5/10
- Cross-Platform: 8.0/10
```

**‚úÖ REPLACE WITH:**
```
- Frontend (Flutter/Dart): 8.0/10 (strong capabilities, limited visual/UI feedback)
- Backend/Data: 8.5/10 (excellent guidance for data architecture)
- Native Integrations: 7.5/10 (good guidance, complex scenarios require iteration)
- Cross-Platform: 7.0/10 (strong development guidance, manual deployment required)
```

### 7. PaddleOCR Accuracy Claims

**‚ùå ADJUST THIS:**
```
"PaddleOCR: 89-92% accuracy vs Tesseract: 60-70%"
```

**‚úÖ REPLACE WITH:**
```
"PaddleOCR: 85-96% accuracy on receipts/invoices (depending on image quality) vs Tesseract: highly variable performance depending on image quality and layout complexity"
```

### 8. Add Limitation Acknowledgments

**‚úÖ ADD THESE SECTIONS WHERE MISSING:**

#### Claude Code Limitations Section:
```
### Claude Code Realistic Limitations
- Visual feedback limitations for complex UI work
- Manual deployment and CI/CD setup required  
- May miss obvious interaction design patterns
- Complex integration scenarios require multiple iterations
- Cannot directly debug on physical devices
```

#### Development Risk Factors:
```
### Risk Factors for Timeline/Budget
- Learning curve for first-time mobile development
- Device-specific testing requirements
- App store submission complexities  
- OCR integration complexity may require multiple iterations
- Performance optimization needs based on real-world testing
```

## üü¢ MINOR CORRECTIONS

### 9. BMAD Framework Clarification

**‚ùå IMPLIES INDUSTRY STANDARD:**
```
"BMAD (Business, Marketing, Analytics, Development) is a structured approach to product development"
```

**‚úÖ CLARIFY AS CUSTOM:**
```
"BMAD (Business, Marketing, Analytics, Development) is a structured development methodology implemented in this project ecosystem"
```

### 10. Technical Capability Context

**‚úÖ ADD CONTEXT TO TECHNICAL CLAIMS:**

After each high rating, add realistic context:
```
*Note: Rating reflects AI guidance capability; implementation success depends on iterative development and testing with real users.*
```

## üìä STATISTICAL CLAIMS REQUIRING SOURCES

### Claims That Need Verification or Removal:

1. **Any decimal-precision ratings (9.2/10, 8.8/10)** - Remove unless actual survey data available
2. **Specific crash rate percentages** - Replace with qualitative comparisons  
3. **Exact processing speeds** - Keep only verifiable benchmarks (Papa Parse confirmed)
4. **User satisfaction percentages** - Replace with qualitative assessments
5. **Market penetration statistics** - Remove unless from verified market research

## üéØ REPLACEMENT TEXT PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: Statistics Without Sources
**‚ùå Replace:** "X% of users report..."  
**‚úÖ With:** "Users commonly report..." or "A significant portion of users experience..."

### Pattern 2: Precise Success Probabilities  
**‚ùå Replace:** "90% success probability"  
**‚úÖ With:** "High success potential" or "Strong likelihood of success"

### Pattern 3: Extreme Performance Claims
**‚ùå Replace:** "4x faster" or "99% cost reduction"  
**‚úÖ With:** "Significantly faster" or "Substantial cost reduction"

### Pattern 4: Unqualified Capability Ratings
**‚ùå Replace:** "9.5/10 rating"  
**‚úÖ With:** "8.0/10 rating with noted limitations in [specific area]"

### Phase 2 (Important - For Credibility):
1. Adjust capability ratings with context
2. Clarify BMAD framework status
3. Add risk factor discussions
4. Provide uncertainty acknowledgments

### Phase 3 (Polish - For Professional Quality):
1. Ensure all claims have appropriate qualifiers
2. Replace assumptions with validated facts
3. Add proper context to remaining statistics
4. Include methodology notes where applicable
