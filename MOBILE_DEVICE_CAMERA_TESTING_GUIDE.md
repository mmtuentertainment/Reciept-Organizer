```

---

## **HEIC VS JPEG COMPATIBILITY ISSUES (VALIDATED)**

### **iOS HEIC Behavior** ✅
```
DEFAULT FORMAT: HEIC since iOS 11 (High Efficiency setting)
COMPATIBILITY REQUIREMENT: iOS 11+ or macOS High Sierra+ to view/edit
AUTOMATIC CONVERSION: May convert to JPEG during import to non-Apple systems
SETTINGS OVERRIDE: Camera > Formats > Most Compatible forces JPEG
ORIGINAL PRESERVATION: Photos app settings affect import behavior
```

### **Developer-Specific Issues** ✅
```
LOADING ERRORS: Beta versions report "Cannot load representation of type public.jpeg"
AUTOMATIC CONVERSION: itemProvider.loadObject may convert HEIC to JPEG automatically
GAIN MAP PRESERVATION: HEIC codec preserves ISO 21496-1 gain maps, JPEG converts to Apple format
CROSS-PLATFORM: Non-iPhone devices generally don't support HEIC format
```

---

## **EXIF METADATA HANDLING DIFFERENCES (VALIDATED)**

### **Android EXIF Handling** ✅
```
CAMERAX ROTATION: Handles rotation complexities automatically
EXIF RETRIEVAL: Exif.createFromInputStream() available for extraction
ROTATION METADATA: ImageProxy includes rotation information
TARGET ROTATION: setTargetRotation() for orientation handling
ORIENTATION SUPPORT: Force fullSensor for all 4 orientations
```

### **iOS EXIF Handling** ✅
```
AVCAPTUREPHOTO: Doesn't physically rotate buffers, uses EXIF orientation
UIIMAGE CONVERSION: Causes orientation data loss - DOCUMENTED ISSUE
LANDSCAPE PROBLEMS: Orientation tag '6' images have overwriting issues
METADATA PRESERVATION: Requires CGImageSource/CGImageDestination for proper handling
SOLUTION APPROACH: Save raw image data first, avoid premature UIImage conversion
```

## **STORAGE CONSTRAINTS & FILE LIMITS (VALIDATED)**

### **iOS Storage Limits** ✅
```
TOTAL APP SIZE: Must be < 4GB uncompressed - OFFICIAL LIMIT
APPLE WATCH: Must be < 75MB - OFFICIAL LIMIT
SHARED PHOTOS: Reduced to 2048px on long edge when shared
PANORAMIC EXCEPTION: Up to 5400px wide when shared
SANDBOX RESTRICTIONS: Apps limited to their container directories
ICLOUD OPTIMIZATION: Full-res stored in iCloud, space-saving copies on device
```

### **Android Storage Constraints** ✅
```
NO HARD LIMITS: Individual image files, but memory constraints affect handling
VIDEO LIMIT: 1 minute limit in photo picker for transcoding
PHOTO PICKER: Platform limits on number of selectable files
SCOPED STORAGE: Android 10+ restricts access to app-specific directories
MEMORY MANAGEMENT: Critical for multiple full-sized images
OPTIMIZATION: WebP, AVIF formats reduce file sizes significantly
```
