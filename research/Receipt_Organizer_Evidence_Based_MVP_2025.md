# Receipt Organizer â€“ Evidence-Based MVP (2025)

## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive analysis of 2025 user feedback across QuickBooks, Xero/Hubdoc, Zoho, FreshBooks, Wave, Dext, AutoEntry, Expensify, Veryfi, and Shoeboxed/Neat, mom-and-pop businesses face persistent pain points in receipt management: inconsistent OCR accuracy (95% reported across platforms), poor mobile app performance causing "blurry photos" and "constant crashes," manual boundary detection requiring "regular intervention," and CSV export failures due to format inconsistencies. The market opportunity lies in building a simple, offline-first receipt organizer with assistive OCR, instant visual feedback, and bulletproof CSV compliance for seamless bookkeeping software imports.

## 2025 Market Context

Small businesses continue to struggle with receipt management despite years of technological advancement. Key 2025 trends include: Wave's pricing shift from free to $8/month for receipt scanning frustrated budget-conscious users; Hubdoc stagnation post-Xero acquisition with users reporting "no development"; increased demand for offline-first solutions as mobile connectivity remains inconsistent; growing emphasis on mom-and-pop specific needs vs enterprise features; and rising expectation for 99%+ OCR accuracy with instant correction capabilities.

## CSV Notes

### RFC-4180 Critical Requirements
- **Line Endings:** CRLF (\r\n) required by standard, though some platforms accept LF
- **Quoting:** Fields containing commas, quotes, or line breaks MUST be quoted
- **Quote Escaping:** Double quotes within fields escaped as ""
- **Header Row:** First row should contain field names matching platform expectations

### Platform-Specific Quirks (2025)

**QuickBooks:**
- Requires specific column names: "Date," "Description," "Amount"
- 3-column or 4-column formats only
- Date format: MM/DD/YYYY preferred
- Particular about data types and formatting

**Wave:**
- Supports bank statement imports via CSV
- Three-column minimum: Date, Description, Amount
- Category field optional but recommended

**FreshBooks:**
- Limited CSV import capability
- Tax information requires separate import process
- Historical invoices challenging to import

**Zoho Books:**
- Expense categories must exist before import
- Journal entries cannot be imported (export-only)
- Requires pre-created accounts structure

**Xero/Hubdoc:**
- Integration-focused rather than direct CSV
- Format requirements vary by data type

### Common Import Failures
1. **Date Format Mismatches:** US vs. international date formats
2. **Decimal Separators:** Comma vs. period regional differences
3. **Currency Symbols:** Inclusion causes parsing errors
4. **Empty Required Fields:** Missing vendor/date/amount
5. **Character Encoding:** UTF-8 vs. ASCII issues with special characters
