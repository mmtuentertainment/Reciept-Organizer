# Vendor Normalization Research Summary for Product Manager

## **üö® CRITICAL REALITY CHECK**

**BOTTOM LINE:** We cannot recommend a specific vendor normalization algorithm yet. The research reveals a fundamental gap - **zero empirical studies exist for SMB receipt vendor name normalization**.

---

## **What We Actually Found (No BS)**

### ‚úÖ **Validated Research**
- **Academic methodology exists** for evaluating string matching algorithms
- **General entity resolution techniques** are well-documented
- **Commercial systems report** 90% accuracy claims (but not for our use case)
- **False merge risks** are real and costly in business contexts

### ‚ùå **Critical Research Gaps**
- **No SMB receipt vendor studies** found in academic literature
- **No performance benchmarks** for our specific use case
- **No OCR impact analysis** on business name recognition
- **No comparative studies** of algorithms on retail/restaurant names

## **PM Decision Framework**

### **Option 1: Build Without Validation (HIGH RISK)**
- **Risk:** Unknown performance, potentially wasted development effort
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks implementation
- **Outcome:** Unpredictable - could work great or fail completely

### **Option 2: Research-First Approach (RECOMMENDED)**
- **Phase 1:** Collect 500+ real SMB vendor names from receipts
- **Phase 2:** Create ground truth dataset with entity mappings  
- **Phase 3:** Test deterministic vs phonetic algorithms
- **Phase 4:** Implement winning approach
- **Timeline:** 4-6 weeks total
- **Outcome:** Evidence-based decision with predictable performance

### **Option 3: Simple Fallback (SAFE)**
- **Implementation:** Basic exact matching + manual review queue
- **Performance:** Lower automation but predictable
- **Timeline:** 1 week
- **Outcome:** Functional but requires more user interaction

## **What We Can Build Right Now**

### **Evaluation Framework (Ready)**
- Complete testing framework for algorithm comparison
- Performance measurement methodology
- Validation protocols

### **Algorithm Candidates (Need Testing)**
- **Deterministic:** Case folding, punctuation removal, token sorting
- **Phonetic:** Soundex, Metaphone variants
- **Hybrid:** Combination approaches

## **Resource Requirements for Proper Research**

### **Data Collection**
- **Need:** 500+ actual SMB receipt vendor names
- **Source:** User receipts, industry datasets, or manual collection
- **Effort:** 1-2 weeks

### **Ground Truth Creation**
- **Need:** Manual entity mapping (which names refer to same business)
- **Quality:** Inter-annotator agreement validation
- **Effort:** 1-2 weeks

### **Algorithm Testing**
- **Implementation:** Test candidate algorithms on dataset
- **Measurement:** Precision, recall, false merge rates
- **Effort:** 1-2 weeks

## **PM Recommendation**

### **For MVP Timeline Pressure:**
Choose **Option 3 (Simple Fallback)**
- Implement basic exact matching
- Build manual review interface
- Collect real user data during beta
- Use data for proper algorithm research in v2

### **For Quality-First Approach:**
Choose **Option 2 (Research-First)**
- Invest 4-6 weeks in proper validation
- Deliver evidence-based solution
- Avoid costly rework later

## **Key Questions for PM Decision**

1. **Do we have access to real SMB receipt data?**
   - If YES ‚Üí Research-first approach viable
   - If NO ‚Üí Must start with simple fallback

2. **What's our tolerance for unknown performance?**
   - HIGH ‚Üí Build and iterate
   - LOW ‚Üí Research first

3. **How important is vendor normalization to MVP success?**
   - CRITICAL ‚Üí Invest in research
   - NICE-TO-HAVE ‚Üí Simple fallback acceptable
