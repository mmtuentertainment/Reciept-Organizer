# Receipt Organizer – Evidence-Based MVP (2025)

## Executive Summary

2025 market research reveals a clear opportunity for mom-and-pop focused receipt organizers. Current solutions suffer from poor OCR accuracy (users report 60-80% accuracy vs. promised 95%+), complex workflows designed for enterprises, and CSV import failures causing bookkeeping headaches. Wave's pricing shift and Hubdoc's stagnation have created openings. The MVP should focus on assistive OCR with confidence indicators, bulletproof CSV compliance, and offline-first mobile experience specifically for small businesses processing 20-200 receipts monthly.

## 2025 Market Context

**Key Market Shifts:**
- Wave eliminated free tier (now $8/month) causing user exodus to competitors
- Hubdoc development stagnated post-Xero acquisition with no major updates since 2024
- Small business economic pressure increasing demand for simple, affordable solutions
- Mobile-first expectation with offline capabilities due to connectivity issues
- 99%+ OCR accuracy demand with instant correction UX

**Mom-and-Pop Specific Pain Points:**
- Enterprise features overwhelming simple receipt tracking needs
- Integration complexity exceeding technical capabilities
- Pricing designed for volume users, not occasional processors
- Support designed for IT departments, not individual business owners
