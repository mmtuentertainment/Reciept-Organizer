## ‚ùå UNVERIFIED ASSUMPTIONS (Presented as Facts)

### Statistical Claims Without Sources
| **Claimed Statistic** | **Issue** | **Replacement Needed** |
|-----------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| "Flutter: 0.02% crash rate" | No source for specific percentage | "Flutter demonstrates superior stability" |
| "React Native: 0.08% crash rate" | No source for specific percentage | "React Native shows more stability issues" |
| "90%+ success probability" | No methodology provided | "High success potential" |
| "OCR complaint frequency: 9.2/10" | Decimal precision suggests survey data not available | "OCR inaccuracy is the primary user complaint" |
| "User satisfaction: 8.8/10" | No survey source | "Users express significant dissatisfaction" |

### Cost-Benefit Calculations
| **Claim** | **Issue** | **Reality** |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| "$98K-$528K cost savings" | Inflated baseline comparison | More realistic: $40K-$120K potential savings |
| "99%+ cost reduction" | Mathematical error, unrealistic | Realistic: 35-50% cost reduction |
| "4x faster development" | Exceeds industry acceleration norms | Realistic: ~2x faster |

### Capability Assessments  
| **Claim** | **Issue** | **Correction Needed** |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| Claude Code "9.5/10" frontend rating | Documented limitations not reflected | Adjust to 8.0/10 with limitation notes |
| "Can guide 90%+ of development tasks" | Percentage unsubstantiated | "Can provide significant guidance" |
| Native integration "8.5/10" | Complexity understated | Adjust to 7.5/10 with iteration requirements |

## üîç METHODOLOGY ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Pattern 1: Precision Without Source
**Issue:** Using decimal ratings (9.2/10, 8.8/10) without citing quantitative research
**Example:** "OCR inaccuracy affects 9.2/10 users"
**Problem:** Suggests scientific precision where none exists
**Fix:** Use qualitative descriptors ("commonly," "frequently," "most users")

### Pattern 2: Optimistic Capability Ratings
**Issue:** Rating capabilities 8.5-9.5/10 without acknowledging documented limitations  
**Example:** Claude Code frontend development rated 9.5/10
**Problem:** Ignores known visual feedback and UI limitations
**Fix:** Include limitation context and reduce ratings appropriately

### Pattern 3: Extreme Benefit Claims
**Issue:** Claiming unrealistic acceleration (4x) or savings (99%+)
**Example:** "4x faster development time"
**Problem:** Exceeds realistic expectations, sets false expectations
**Fix:** Use industry-validated acceleration rates (~2x)

### Pattern 4: Assumption Conflation
**Issue:** Presenting estimates and assumptions as verified facts
**Example:** Success probability calculations without risk modeling
**Problem:** Misleads decision-makers about uncertainty levels
**Fix:** Clear distinction between facts, estimates, and assumptions

## üìä CONFIDENCE LEVELS FOR KEY CLAIMS

### HIGH CONFIDENCE (Can State as Fact)
- **Technology Stack Appropriateness**: Flutter + PaddleOCR + offline-first is well-suited
- **Relative Performance**: PaddleOCR outperforms Tesseract for receipt OCR  
- **Development Approach**: Cross-platform reduces timeline and costs
- **Market Need**: OCR accuracy issues create genuine opportunity
- **Architecture Soundness**: Offline-first mobile approach appropriate for target users

### MEDIUM CONFIDENCE (Qualified Statements)
- **Specific Accuracy Ranges**: PaddleOCR 85-96% accuracy (context-dependent)
- **Development Timeline**: 4-6 months realistic with experienced guidance
- **Cost Reduction**: 35-50% savings compared to traditional native development
- **Claude Code Effectiveness**: Strong guidance capabilities with noted limitations

### LOW CONFIDENCE (Assumptions Only)
- **Exact Success Probability**: Cannot quantify without risk modeling
- **Specific User Satisfaction Metrics**: Need actual user research
- **Precise Performance Comparisons**: Crash rates, processing speeds vary by implementation
- **Market Penetration Projections**: Require actual market testing

2. **Cost Savings**: Provide realistic ranges based on industry data  
3. **Timeline Estimates**: Include risk factors and variables

### For User Research:
1. **Satisfaction Claims**: Qualify as "commonly reported" vs. specific ratings
2. **Pain Point Analysis**: Use qualitative descriptions of frequency
3. **Market Needs**: Cite sources or present as assumptions requiring validation

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

To transform the analysis into a credible assessment:

### Phase 1: Remove Unsupported Statistics
- [ ] Replace specific crash rate percentages with qualitative comparisons
- [ ] Remove decimal-precision user satisfaction ratings
- [ ] Replace success probability percentages with qualitative assessments

### Phase 2: Add Proper Context
- [ ] Include limitation acknowledgments for all capability ratings
- [ ] Add uncertainty qualifiers to projections
- [ ] Distinguish between verified facts and reasonable estimates

### Phase 3: Adjust Extreme Claims
- [ ] Reduce timeline acceleration claims to realistic levels (2x not 4x)
- [ ] Adjust cost savings to industry-validated ranges (35-50% not 99%+)
- [ ] Balance optimistic projections with risk factors

### Phase 4: Source Attribution
- [ ] Cite sources for all performance benchmarks
- [ ] Acknowledge when claims are estimates vs. facts
- [ ] Provide methodology notes for any calculations
