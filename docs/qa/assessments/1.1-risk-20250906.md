## ðŸš¨ Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### TECH-001: Memory Exhaustion in Batch Processing
**Score: 9 (Critical)**

**Probability:** High (3) - Multiple high-resolution receipt images (10+ @ ~5MB each) combined with OCR processing will likely exceed mobile memory constraints

**Impact:** High (3) - Application crashes during core feature usage, potential data loss, severe user experience degradation

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Batch processing of 10 receipts simultaneously
- High-resolution camera captures (~5MB per image)
- OCR processing requires additional memory allocation
- Target devices may have limited RAM available to app

**Immediate Mitigation Required:**
- **Progressive Image Processing:** Process receipts sequentially rather than simultaneously
- **Image Compression:** Reduce image resolution to 1MP for OCR processing (retain originals)
- **Memory Monitoring:** Implement real-time memory usage tracking with alerts
- **Graceful Degradation:** Reduce batch size automatically when memory pressure detected
- **Resource Cleanup:** Aggressive cleanup of processed images from memory

**Testing Focus:**
- Memory profiling on target devices (iPhone 12, Samsung S22)  
- Stress testing with 20+ receipts to identify breaking points
- Background app switching during batch processing
- Low memory device simulation testing

**Acceptance Criteria Impact:** Directly threatens AC1 (10 receipts <3min) if app crashes
