### Critical Gaps

**NONE IDENTIFIED** - All acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage across multiple levels.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on the comprehensive test design already created:

1. **Priority Execution Order**
   - Execute P0 security tests first (blocking)
   - Follow with data integrity tests
   - Complete with user workflow tests

2. **Additional Considerations**
   - Add accessibility tests for screen reader support
   - Consider adding mutation testing for critical logic
   - Implement contract testing for service boundaries

### Risk Assessment

```poml
RISK_COVERAGE_ASSESSMENT:
  high_risk_requirements:
    - requirement: "Authorization checks"
      coverage: FULL
      test_levels: ["unit", "integration", "e2e"]
      
    - requirement: "Data recovery (undo)"
      coverage: FULL
      test_levels: ["unit", "integration", "e2e"]
      
  medium_risk_requirements:
    - requirement: "Performance with large batches"
      coverage: FULL
      test_levels: ["unit", "e2e"]
      
  low_risk_requirements:
    - requirement: "Visual feedback"
      coverage: FULL
      test_levels: ["integration"]
```

### Quality Indicators

âœ… **Excellent Coverage Achieved**:
- Every AC has multiple test levels
- Critical paths have unit + integration + E2E
- Security requirements extensively tested
- Performance requirements validated
- Edge cases explicitly covered

### Test Completeness Score
