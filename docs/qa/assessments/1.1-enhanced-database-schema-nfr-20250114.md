# NFR Assessment: Story 1.1 - Enhanced Database Schema with Categories & Tags

Date: 2025-01-14
Assessor: Quinn (Test Architect)
NFRs Assessed: Security, Performance, Reliability, Maintainability

## Security Assessment

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence Found:**
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies defined for both tables
- Uses Supabase auth.uid() for user isolation
- Foreign key constraints prevent orphaned data
- No hardcoded credentials requirement specified

**Validation Method:**
- RLS policies can be tested with multiple user contexts
- Constraint violations testable via integration tests

**Notes:** Strong security design with proper user isolation

## Performance Assessment

**Status: CONCERNS**

**Evidence Found:**
- Multiple indexes defined for query optimization
- GIN index for array operations
- Appropriate index on date and user_id

**Concerns:**
- No explicit performance targets defined
- Index creation during migration could lock tables
- No guidance on expected data volumes

**Recommendations:**
- Define response time targets (<200ms for queries)
- Apply indexes AFTER data migration to avoid locks
- Consider partial indexes for large tables

## Reliability Assessment

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence Found:**
- Constraints ensure data integrity (positive amounts, valid currency)
- Foreign key cascades handle user deletion cleanly
- NOT NULL constraints on critical fields
- Trigger for automatic timestamp updates

**Validation Method:**
- Constraint testing via unit tests
- Cascade behavior testable in integration

**Notes:** Good reliability design with appropriate constraints

## Maintainability Assessment

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence Found:**
- Clear table and column naming conventions
- Proper use of PostgreSQL features (arrays, JSONB potential)
- Migration approach using Supabase MCP
- Documented schema with comments

**Validation Method:**
- Code review for naming standards
- Migration script clarity

**Notes:** Well-structured schema that will be maintainable

## Summary

### Overall NFR Status: CONCERNS

While security, reliability, and maintainability are well-addressed, performance concerns need attention:

1. **Critical**: Define explicit performance targets
2. **Important**: Plan index creation strategy to avoid locks
3. **Recommended**: Load test with realistic data volumes

### Gate YAML Block

```yaml
# Gate YAML (copy/paste):
nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'RLS policies properly defined with auth.uid() isolation'
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'No performance targets defined, index creation could lock tables during migration'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Appropriate constraints and cascades ensure data integrity'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clear naming conventions and proper PostgreSQL feature usage'
```

## Recommendations for Dev

1. **Performance Targets**: Add explicit targets to story:
   - Receipt list query: <200ms for 1000 records
   - Tag search: <300ms for 10K records
   - Category filter: <150ms

2. **Index Strategy**: Modify migration approach:
   ```sql
   -- First: Migrate data with basic structure
   -- Then: CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY to avoid locks
   ```

3. **Monitoring**: Plan for performance monitoring post-deployment

## Test Focus Areas

Based on NFR assessment:
- **Security**: Cross-user access attempts (P0)
- **Performance**: Load testing with 10K+ records (P1)
- **Reliability**: Constraint violation handling (P1)
- **Maintainability**: Migration rollback testing (P2)
