Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Medium Risks: 3
- Low Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 49/100 (Moderate Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. DATA-001: Existing Data Migration Failure

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Existing receipts table has data that must be preserved
**Impact**: High (3) - Data loss would be catastrophic for users
**Mitigation**:
- Create careful ALTER TABLE statements instead of DROP/CREATE
- Backup existing data before migration
- Test migration on copy of production data
- Implement rollback procedure
**Testing Focus**:
- Test migration with sample production data
- Verify all existing data preserved after migration
- Test rollback procedure

## High Priority Risks

### 2. SEC-001: Row Level Security Bypass

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex RLS policies can have gaps
**Impact**: High (3) - Users could access other users' receipts
**Mitigation**:
- Thoroughly test RLS policies with multiple user scenarios
- Use Supabase's built-in auth.uid() consistently
- Test with different authentication states
**Testing Focus**: Cross-user access testing, edge cases with null user_id

### 3. PERF-001: Missing Index Performance Degradation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Multiple new indexes on large tables
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Slow queries affecting user experience
**Mitigation**:
- Apply indexes after data migration to avoid lock issues
- Monitor query performance post-deployment
- Consider partial indexes for large tables
**Testing Focus**: Load testing with realistic data volumes

## Medium Priority Risks

### 4. TECH-001: Migration Script Syntax Errors

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex SQL with multiple statements
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Migration failure requiring fixes
**Mitigation**:
- Test migration locally first
- Use Supabase CLI for validation
- Review SQL syntax carefully
**Testing Focus**: Dry run migrations in test environment

### 5. DATA-002: Currency Constraint Too Restrictive

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - International users may use various currencies
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Users unable to save receipts with non-standard currencies
**Mitigation**:
- Consider relaxing constraint or maintaining currency lookup table
- Provide default but allow override
**Testing Focus**: Test with various currency codes

### 6. OPS-001: Production Deployment Timing

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Schema changes during active use
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Brief downtime or failed transactions
**Mitigation**:
- Deploy during low-traffic window
- Use transaction wrapping for atomicity
- Prepare maintenance mode if needed
**Testing Focus**: Test deployment procedure

## Low Priority Risks

### 7. BUS-001: Category Limitations

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - 100 character limit is reasonable
**Impact**: High (3) - Some users may want longer category names
**Mitigation**:
- Document limitation in UI
- Provide tooltip with character count
**Testing Focus**: UI validation testing

### 8. TECH-002: Trigger Function Conflicts

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Simple trigger unlikely to conflict
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Updated_at might not update correctly
**Mitigation**:
- Test trigger thoroughly
- Monitor for proper timestamp updates
**Testing Focus**: Verify trigger fires on updates

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Data Migration Testing**
  - Create test dataset matching production schema
  - Run migration and verify data integrity
  - Test rollback procedure
  - Verify no data loss

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Security Testing**
  - Test RLS with multiple users
  - Attempt cross-user data access
  - Test with unauthenticated requests
- **Performance Testing**
  - Load test with 10K+ receipts
  - Query performance benchmarks
  - Index effectiveness testing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Standard migration validation
- Constraint testing
- Trigger functionality verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- DATA-001: Migration must preserve all existing data
- SEC-001: RLS policies must be thoroughly tested

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- PERF-001: With monitoring and rollback plan
- TECH-001: After local testing passes
- DATA-002: With documented workaround
- OPS-001: With scheduled maintenance window

### Accepted Risks
- BUS-001: Category limit acceptable for MVP
- TECH-002: Low probability, monitoring sufficient

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Query performance metrics (PERF-001)
- Failed constraint violations (DATA-002)
- RLS policy denials (SEC-001)
- Trigger execution logs (TECH-002)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Production data volume exceeds 100K receipts
- Security audit performed
- Performance issues reported
- Additional tables added to schema
