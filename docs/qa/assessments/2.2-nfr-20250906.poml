conclusion: |
  Story 2.2 demonstrates strong NFR compliance with well-designed performance targets,
  solid security considerations, and excellent maintainability through clean architecture.
  The conditional pass on reliability is due to the inherent complexity of merchant name
  normalization which requires extensive testing to ensure edge cases are handled correctly.
  With the recommended test coverage and monitoring in place, this story is ready for
  development with confidence that NFR requirements will be met.
