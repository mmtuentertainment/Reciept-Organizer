## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### üî¥ HIGH RISKS (Score 6) - MUST ADDRESS

### 1. [TECH-001]: State Management Integration Complexity

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Complex integration with existing providers  
**Impact:** High (3) - Could break entire capture workflow  

**Risk Details:**
Modifying existing CaptureProvider and ReceiptProvider to support inline field editing could introduce regressions in the established capture workflow from Stories 1.1-1.4.

**Mitigation:**
- Create comprehensive integration test suite before modifying existing providers
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout of editing functionality  
- Establish rollback procedures for provider state changes
- Add extensive unit tests for all provider method modifications

**Testing Focus:**
- End-to-end capture workflow regression testing
- Provider state transition validation  
- Cross-screen state consistency verification

### 2. [TECH-002]: Multi-Screen Consistency Risk

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**  
**Probability:** High (3) - Multiple integration points  
**Impact:** Medium (2) - User experience degradation  

**Risk Details:**
Inline editing must work consistently across PreviewScreen, ReceiptDetailScreen, and ReceiptList. Different implementation approaches could create inconsistent user experiences.

**Mitigation:**
- Create shared FieldEditor component used across all screens
- Establish UI consistency validation tests
- Document editing behavior standards for all integration points
- Implement automated visual regression testing

**Testing Focus:**
- Cross-screen editing behavior consistency tests
- UI component integration validation
- User workflow continuity verification

### 3. [PERF-001]: Touch Response Performance Risk

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Aggressive mobile performance target  
**Impact:** High (3) - Poor user experience if missed  

**Risk Details:**
<16ms touch response requirement is extremely aggressive for mobile devices, especially older/slower devices. Complex edit mode activation could exceed this threshold.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement performance monitoring for touch events
- Optimize edit mode activation with pre-rendered components
- Add performance regression tests in CI pipeline
- Consider progressive enhancement for older devices

**Testing Focus:**
- Touch response latency measurement on target devices
- Performance testing under various system loads
- Memory pressure impact on responsiveness

### 4. [DATA-001]: Auto-save Failure Data Loss

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**  
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Network/storage issues possible  
**Impact:** High (3) - User loses manual corrections  

**Risk Details:**
Auto-save failures could result in users losing their manual field corrections without clear indication, creating a frustrating experience.

**Mitigation:**
- Implement robust error handling with user notifications
- Add local draft persistence for unsaved changes
- Create manual save fallback options
- Establish clear visual indicators for save status

**Testing Focus:**
- Auto-save failure scenarios and recovery testing
- Network interruption handling validation  
- User notification clarity and effectiveness

### 5. [OPS-001]: Complex Integration Testing Requirements

**Score: 6 (High Risk)**  
**Probability:** High (3) - Multiple integration points to validate  
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Deployment complexity and potential delays  

**Risk Details:**
Modifications across multiple screens, providers, and components significantly increase testing complexity and potential deployment risks.

**Mitigation:**
- Create comprehensive testing strategy covering all integration points
- Implement staged deployment with feature flags
- Establish clear rollback procedures for each component
- Add monitoring for all modified components post-deployment

**Testing Focus:**
- Integration test coverage for all component interactions
- Deployment validation procedures
- Component-specific monitoring and alerting
