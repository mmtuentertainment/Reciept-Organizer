Story: 3.13 - Bulk Delete Processed Receipts

## Executive Summary

- **Total Risks Identified**: 12
- **Critical Risks**: 2 (DATA-001, SEC-001)
- **High Risks**: 3 (PERF-001, DATA-002, OPS-001)
- **Medium Risks**: 3
- **Low Risks**: 4
- **Risk Score**: 34/100 (High Risk Story - Requires Careful Implementation)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. DATA-001: Permanent Data Loss Without Proper Backup

**Score: 9 (Critical)**

**Probability**: High - Users will regularly use bulk delete for storage management

**Impact**: High - Irrecoverable loss of financial records, potential compliance violations

**Mitigation**:
- Implement mandatory "Export before delete" option in confirmation dialog
- Extend soft delete window from 30 seconds to configurable period (default 7 days)
- Add automated backup of deleted items to archive storage
- Create comprehensive recovery procedures documentation

**Testing Focus**: 
- Verify export functionality works before deletion
- Test recovery from soft-deleted state at various time intervals
- Validate backup creation and restoration

### 2. SEC-001: No Authorization Check for Bulk Delete

**Score: 9 (Critical)**

**Probability**: High - Current implementation lacks user ownership validation

**Impact**: High - Unauthorized deletion of receipts, security breach, data loss

**Mitigation**:
- Add user ownership validation in BulkOperationService
- Implement role-based access control for bulk operations
- Add re-authentication for destructive operations
- Create comprehensive audit log with user ID, timestamp, affected records

**Testing Focus**:
- Security testing for authorization bypass attempts
- Verify only owned receipts can be deleted
- Test audit log completeness and accuracy

## High Risk Areas

### PERF-001: UI Freeze During Large Batch Operations

**Score: 6 (High)**
- **Issue**: Processing 100+ receipts may block UI thread
- **Mitigation**: Implement web workers or background processing
- **Test**: Load test with 500+ receipts

### DATA-002: Image/Database Sync Failure

**Score: 6 (High)**
- **Issue**: Images deleted but DB records remain (or vice versa)
- **Mitigation**: Implement transactional deletion with rollback
- **Test**: Failure injection during deletion process

### OPS-001: No Audit Trail for Deletions

**Score: 6 (High)**
- **Issue**: Cannot track who deleted what and when
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive audit logging
- **Test**: Verify all deletion events are logged

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- **Data Risks**: 3 risks (1 critical, 1 high)
- **Security Risks**: 2 risks (1 critical)
- **Performance Risks**: 2 risks (1 high)
- **Technical Risks**: 2 risks (medium)
- **Business Risks**: 1 risk (medium)
- **Operational Risks**: 2 risks (1 high)

### By Component

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests (MUST HAVE)
- **Authorization Tests**: Verify user can only delete own receipts
- **Data Recovery Tests**: Test soft delete and restoration
- **Export Integration**: Verify export-before-delete flow
- **Audit Logging**: Confirm all operations logged correctly

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests (SHOULD HAVE)
- **Performance Tests**: Load test with 500+ receipts
- **Sync Tests**: Test image/DB consistency during failures
- **Concurrency Tests**: Multiple users deleting simultaneously

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests (NICE TO HAVE)
- **UI Responsiveness**: Test UI during operations
- **Timer Reliability**: Test scheduled deletion timing
- **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- ✅ Authorization checks implemented and tested
- ✅ Export-before-delete option available
- ✅ Audit logging fully functional
- ✅ Soft delete window extended beyond 30 seconds

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- ⚠️ Performance optimization (with monitoring)
- ⚠️ Rate limiting (with alerting)
- ⚠️ Advanced recovery procedures (with manual process)

### Accepted Risks
- Minor UI delays for very large operations (>1000 items)
- Manual intervention for complex recovery scenarios

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Deletion Volume**: Track bulk delete usage patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times for bulk operations
- **Error Rates**: Failed deletion attempts
- **Security Events**: Unauthorized access attempts
- **Data Integrity**: Image/DB sync issues

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- User permissions model changes
- Storage architecture modifications
- Performance issues reported in production
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Compliance requirements change

## Recommendations for Story Improvement

### Immediate Actions Required
1. Add explicit authorization checks in Task 2
2. Implement audit logging in Task 1
3. Extend soft delete window to configurable period
4. Add export-before-delete option in Task 5

### Testing Enhancements
1. Add security test scenarios to integration tests
2. Include load testing for 500+ receipts
3. Add failure injection tests for sync issues
4. Implement audit log verification tests
