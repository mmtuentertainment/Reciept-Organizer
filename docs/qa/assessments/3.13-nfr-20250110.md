```poml
NFR_ASSESSMENT_RESULTS:
  assessed: ["security", "performance", "reliability", "maintainability"]
  quality_score: 50/100
  
  SECURITY: FAIL
    critical_gap: "No authorization checks for bulk delete"
    severity: CRITICAL
    
  PERFORMANCE: CONCERNS  
    issue: "No batch size limits in story tasks"
    risk: "UI freeze with large operations"
    
  RELIABILITY: PASS
    strength: "Soft delete with undo mechanism"
    coverage: "Error handling and recovery defined"
    
  MAINTAINABILITY: CONCERNS
    gap: "Missing accessibility requirements"
    test_coverage: "42 tests defined but no coverage target"
```

- **Security**: FAIL - Missing authorization checks (CRITICAL)
- **Performance**: CONCERNS - Batch processing not optimized
- **Reliability**: PASS - Excellent recovery mechanisms
- **Maintainability**: CONCERNS - Documentation gaps

## Critical Issues

### 1. **No Authorization Checks** (Security - FAIL)

```poml
SECURITY_FAILURE:
  issue: "Any user can delete any receipts"
  evidence: "No ownership validation in tasks"
  risk: "Unauthorized data deletion"
  priority: P0_BLOCKING
  
  REQUIRED_FIX:
    - "Add user ownership validation to BulkOperationService"
    - "Implement RBAC checks before deletion"
    - "Add audit logging for all deletions"
    - "Re-authenticate for destructive operations"
  
  estimated_effort: "4-6 hours"
```

**Risk**: Unauthorized users could delete any receipts in the system
**Fix**: Add authorization checks in Task 2 before BulkOperationService implementation

### 2. **Performance Not Guaranteed** (Performance - CONCERNS)

```poml
PERFORMANCE_CONCERNS:
  batch_processing:
    specified: "10 items per batch"
    location: "Dev Notes section only"
    issue: "Not enforced in tasks"
    
  ui_responsiveness:
    target: "<100ms selection, <3s for 100 deletions"
    validation: "No performance tests in tasks"
    
  storage_calculation:
    approach: "Async mentioned in notes"
    implementation: "Not in Task 5 subtasks"
```

**Risk**: UI could freeze during large operations
**Fix**: Add explicit batch size enforcement in Task 2

### 3. **Excellent Reliability** (Reliability - PASS)

```poml
RELIABILITY_STRENGTHS:
  recovery_mechanisms:
    - "30-second undo window"
    - "Soft delete before permanent"
    - "Timer cancellation on restore"
    
  error_handling:
    - "Rollback capability in Task 2"
    - "Graceful failure recovery"
    - "Progress stream for monitoring"
    
  data_integrity:
    - "Transactional operations mentioned"
    - "Image/DB sync handling"
```

**Strength**: Comprehensive recovery and error handling mechanisms
**No issues identified**

### 4. **Maintainability Gaps** (Maintainability - CONCERNS)

```poml
MAINTAINABILITY_ISSUES:
  accessibility:
    mentioned: "In completion criteria"
    implemented: "No tasks for screen reader support"
    
  documentation:
    test_coverage: "42 tests designed"
    coverage_target: "80% mentioned but not enforced"
    
  code_organization:
    positive: "Clear file structure provided"
    gap: "No coding standards enforcement"
```

**Risk**: Accessibility requirements not implemented
**Fix**: Add accessibility subtasks to Task 3 (UI components)

## Quick Wins

1. **Add Authorization Checks**: ~4 hours
   - Update Task 2 with ownership validation subtask
   - Add audit logging subtask to Task 1

2. **Enforce Batch Limits**: ~2 hours
   - Add explicit batch size configuration in Task 2
   - Add performance test subtask

3. **Accessibility Support**: ~3 hours
   - Add screen reader announcements to Task 3
   - Add keyboard navigation support

4. **Test Coverage Target**: ~1 hour
   - Add coverage measurement to test tasks
   - Set explicit 80% target enforcement

## NFR Requirements Verification

### Security Requirements
- ❌ Authentication/Authorization for operations
- ❌ Audit trail for compliance
- ❌ Rate limiting for bulk operations
- ✅ Soft delete for recovery

### Performance Requirements
- ⚠️ Response time targets defined but not enforced
- ⚠️ Batch processing mentioned but not explicit
- ✅ Async operations for heavy calculations
- ❌ Load testing for 500+ items

### Reliability Requirements
- ✅ Error handling and recovery
- ✅ Undo mechanism (30 seconds)
- ✅ Data consistency (soft delete)
- ✅ Progress feedback

### Maintainability Requirements
- ✅ Clear file structure and organization
- ✅ Comprehensive test design (42 tests)
- ⚠️ Test coverage target not enforced
- ❌ Accessibility implementation missing

## Recommendations

```poml
MANDATORY_FIXES_BEFORE_DEVELOPMENT:
  security:
    - "Add Task 1.5: Implement authorization service"
    - "Add subtask to Task 2: Validate user ownership"
    - "Add subtask to Task 1: Create audit log table"
    
  performance:
    - "Add subtask to Task 2: Enforce batch size limits"
    - "Add Task 8: Performance testing with 500+ items"
    
  accessibility:
    - "Add subtask to Task 3: Screen reader announcements"
    - "Add subtask to Task 3: Keyboard navigation"
```

## Quality Score Calculation

```
Starting Score: 100
- Security FAIL: -20 (critical authorization missing)
- Performance CONCERNS: -10 (batch limits not enforced)
- Reliability PASS: 0 (excellent implementation)
- Maintainability CONCERNS: -10 (accessibility gaps)
- Additional Security Critical: -10 (no audit logging)

Final Score: 50/100
```
