## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

No critical risks identified. Previous high-risk items have been successfully mitigated through implementation.

## High Risks (Score 6)

### 1. PERF-002: Memory Usage with Large Date Ranges

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - May occur with users having 5000+ receipts
**Impact**: High (3) - App could crash or become unresponsive
**Mitigation**:
- Implement pagination for date range results
- Add memory monitoring to DateRangeProvider
- Consider virtual scrolling for large result sets
**Testing Focus**: Load test with 5000+ receipts across 2 years

## Medium Risks (Score 4)

### 2. DATA-002: Date Timezone Handling

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Different device timezones
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Export dates may be off by one day
**Mitigation**:
- Store all dates in UTC
- Convert to local timezone for display only
- Add timezone tests
**Residual Risk**: Low with proper implementation

### 3. TECH-003: State Synchronization Issues

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex state interactions
**Impact**: Medium (2) - UI inconsistencies
**Mitigation**:
- Review Riverpod provider dependencies
- Add integration tests for state changes
- Monitor for race conditions

### 4. BUS-001: Export Format Compatibility

**Score: 4 (Medium)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Accounting software variations
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Users may need manual adjustments
**Mitigation**:
- Validate against latest QuickBooks/Xero specs
- Add format validation before export
- Provide clear format documentation

## Low Risks (Score 2-3)

### 5. TECH-004: Widget Rebuild Performance
- **Score: 3** - Unnecessary rebuilds with date changes
- **Mitigation**: Optimize with const constructors and selectors

### 6. SEC-001: Settings Persistence Security
- **Score: 3** - Preferences stored in plain text
- **Mitigation**: Low risk as no sensitive data stored

### 7. DATA-003: Date Format Localization
- **Score: 3** - Non-US date formats may confuse
- **Mitigation**: Add locale-aware date formatting

### 8. OPS-001: Migration Path for Existing Users
- **Score: 2** - Settings migration needed
- **Mitigation**: Default values handle missing preferences

### 9. TECH-005: Database Index Maintenance
- **Score: 2** - Index fragmentation over time
- **Mitigation**: Monitor query performance

### 10. BUS-002: User Education
- **Score: 2** - Users may not understand presets
- **Mitigation**: Add help tooltips

### 11. PERF-003: Export Preview Performance
- **Score: 2** - Preview generation for large sets
- **Mitigation**: Limit preview to first 100 rows

### 12. DATA-004: Leap Year Edge Cases
- **Score: 2** - Feb 29 handling
- **Mitigation**: Existing date libraries handle correctly

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- Memory stress test with 5000+ receipts
- Performance profiling during date range queries
- Concurrent user simulation

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests  
- Timezone boundary tests (DST transitions)
- Cross-timezone export/import validation
- State management race condition tests
- Export format compliance tests

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Widget performance benchmarks
- Localization testing
- Migration scenario testing
- Edge case date validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- PERF-002: Implement pagination or virtual scrolling

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- DATA-002: Document timezone behavior
- TECH-003: Monitor error rates
- BUS-001: Provide format guides

### Accepted Risks
- SEC-001: No sensitive data in preferences
- TECH-005: Monitor performance metrics

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Memory usage patterns (PERF-002)
- Query performance metrics (PERF-001 - resolved)
- Export success rates (BUS-001)
- Error rates for date parsing (DATA-002)
- User engagement with presets (BUS-002)

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- User base grows beyond 10,000 active users
- Export volume exceeds 1000/day
- New accounting software support added
- Performance degradation detected
- Major Flutter/package updates

## Improvements from Pre-Implementation

### Successfully Mitigated
1. **PERF-001** (Was High): Database index implemented, queries <100ms
2. **DATA-001** (Was High): Date parsing consolidated with CSVExportService
3. **TEST-001** (Was Medium): Comprehensive performance tests created

### Risk Score Improvement
- Pre-implementation: 71/100 (Moderate Risk)
- Post-implementation: 76/100 (Low Risk)
- Improvement: +5 points through successful mitigation
