# Test Design: T1.1 - Create Repository and Service Interfaces

**Story ID**: T1.1  
**Title**: Create Repository and Service Interfaces  
**Date**: 2025-01-11  
**Designer**: Quinn (Test Architect)  
**Test Priority**: P0-CRITICAL  
**Coverage Target**: 100% (Interfaces are contracts)

## Test Strategy Overview

Given the critical nature of these interfaces as the foundation for the entire hybrid cloud transformation, we require a **multi-layered testing approach** with emphasis on contract testing, behavior verification, and cross-implementation compatibility.

## Test Levels & Distribution

| Level | Coverage | Priority | Purpose |
|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| **Contract Tests** | 100% | P0 | Ensure all implementations comply with interface contracts |
| **Unit Tests** | 100% | P0 | Verify individual method behaviors |
| **Integration Tests** | 80% | P1 | Validate interface interactions |
| **Migration Tests** | 100% | P0 | Ensure safe transition from direct access |
| **Performance Tests** | Key Operations | P1 | Baseline and regression detection |

## Migration Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Adapter Tests
```dart
// Test M1: SQLite to IReceiptRepository Adapter
Given: Existing SQLite database
When: Adapter wraps old implementation
Then:
  - All interface methods work
  - No data loss
  - Performance acceptable

// Test M2: Path Provider to IImageStorageService Adapter
Given: Existing file system images
When: Adapter wraps path_provider
Then:
  - Images accessible via interface
  - Paths correctly mapped
  - Cleanup still works
```

### Phase 2: Parallel Run Tests
```dart
// Test M3: Dual Write Verification
Given: Both old and new implementations
When: Operations performed
Then:
  - Both systems updated
  - Data consistency maintained
  - Rollback possible
```

## Performance Test Scenarios

### Baseline Metrics (P1)

| Operation | Current (SQLite) | Target (Interface) | Max Degradation |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Single Read | < 10ms | < 15ms | 50% |
| Batch Read (100) | < 100ms | < 150ms | 50% |
| Single Write | < 20ms | < 30ms | 50% |
| Image Load | < 500ms | < 600ms | 20% |
| Search (1000 records) | < 200ms | < 300ms | 50% |

### Load Tests

```dart
// Test P1: Concurrent Operations
Given: 10 concurrent users
When: Mixed read/write operations
Then:
  - No deadlocks
  - Response time < 2x baseline
  - Memory stable

// Test P2: Large Dataset
Given: 10,000 receipts, 50,000 images
When: Standard operations performed
Then:
  - Pagination works efficiently
  - Search remains responsive
  - No memory leaks
```

## Test Data Requirements

### Mock Data Sets
1. **Basic Set**: 10 receipts for simple tests
2. **Pagination Set**: 100+ receipts for list tests
3. **Date Range Set**: 365 receipts (one year)
4. **Search Set**: Various merchants, amounts, descriptions
5. **Image Set**: JPEG, PNG, various sizes
6. **Conflict Set**: Simulated sync conflicts

### Test Fixtures
```dart
class TestFixtures {
  static Receipt validReceipt() => Receipt(...);
  static Receipt invalidReceipt() => Receipt(id: null);
  static Uint8List smallImage() => /* 100KB JPEG */;
  static Uint8List largeImage() => /* 10MB PNG */;
  static User authenticatedUser() => User(...);
}
```

## Test Execution Plan

### Priority 0 (Must Pass Before Merge)
1. All interface compilation tests
2. Basic CRUD operations
3. Error handling for all methods
4. Mock implementation compatibility

### Priority 1 (Must Pass Before Release)
1. Pagination and filtering
2. Performance baselines
3. Concurrent operation tests
4. Migration adapter tests

### Priority 2 (Should Pass Eventually)
1. Edge cases and error scenarios
2. Load and stress tests
3. Security and permission tests
4. Platform-specific behaviors

## Success Criteria

### Definition of Done
- [ ] 100% line coverage for interfaces
- [ ] All P0 tests passing
- [ ] 90% of P1 tests passing
- [ ] Contract tests for all methods
- [ ] Performance within targets
- [ ] No memory leaks detected
- [ ] Mock implementations validated
- [ ] Migration tests successful

### Quality Gates
1. **Gate 1**: Interfaces compile and have contracts
2. **Gate 2**: Mock implementations pass all contracts
3. **Gate 3**: Existing code successfully adapted
4. **Gate 4**: Performance acceptable
5. **Gate 5**: All tracks can use interfaces

## Risk-Based Test Focus

Given the risk assessment score of 9/9, prioritize:

1. **Contract Compliance** - Every implementation MUST honor contracts
2. **Migration Safety** - Zero data loss during transition
3. **Performance Regression** - Monitor all operations
4. **Cross-Track Compatibility** - Interfaces work for all tracks
5. **Error Recovery** - Graceful handling of all failures

## Recommendations for Development Team

1. **Implement TDD** - Write contract tests before interfaces
2. **Create Mocks First** - Unblock testing immediately (T1.2)
3. **Use Fake Implementations** - For testing without dependencies
4. **Monitor Performance** - From day one
5. **Version Interfaces** - Plan for evolution
6. **Document Contracts** - Beyond just method signatures
