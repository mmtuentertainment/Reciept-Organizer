    title: OpenCV Integration Complexity
    score: 6
    severity: High
    probability: Medium (2)
    impact: High (3)
    description: First-time OpenCV integration in Flutter, potential compatibility issues across iOS/Android platforms
    root_causes:
      - New dependency on OpenCV for Flutter package
      - Platform-specific native library integration challenges
      - Potential version conflicts with existing ML Kit dependencies
      - Build complexity increase for iOS/Android targets
    mitigation_required:
      - Proof of Concept - Create minimal OpenCV integration test before main development
      - Platform Testing - Validate on both iOS and Android build environments early
      - Dependency Management - Carefully test ML Kit + OpenCV coexistence
      - Fallback Strategy - Plan manual crop-only mode if OpenCV integration fails
      - Build Pipeline - Update CI/CD to handle native library dependencies
    testing_focus:
      - Cross-platform build verification
      - OpenCV library loading and initialization
      - Memory footprint impact assessment
      - Performance benchmarking vs manual crop baseline
    ac_impact: Threatens AC1 (80% success rate) if integration fails

  PERF-001:
    title: Real-time Processing Performance Impact
    score: 6
    severity: High
    probability: High (3)
    impact: Medium (2)
    description: Real-time image processing (10fps) combined with camera preview may exceed mobile processing capabilities
    root_causes:
      - Continuous edge detection processing at 10fps
      - OpenCV image processing operations are CPU intensive
      - Concurrent camera preview + edge detection + UI rendering
      - Target devices may lack sufficient processing power
    mitigation_required:
      - Processing Optimization - Implement frame downscaling (e.g., 640x480) for edge detection
      - Adaptive Frame Rate - Reduce processing frequency on lower-end devices
      - Background Processing - Use Flutter isolates for heavy OpenCV operations
      - Performance Monitoring - Real-time FPS and CPU usage tracking
      - Graceful Degradation - Reduce edge detection frequency if performance drops
    testing_focus:
      - Frame rate maintenance during edge detection
      - CPU usage profiling on target devices
      - Battery consumption impact measurement
      - UI responsiveness during real-time processing
    ac_impact: May affect AC5 (real-time processing) on lower-end devices

  PERF-002:
    title: Memory Usage Growth from OpenCV Operations
    score: 6
    severity: High
    probability: Medium (2)
    impact: High (3)
    description: OpenCV operations allocate temporary memory for image processing, potential memory leaks
    root_causes:
      - OpenCV matrix operations create temporary memory allocations
      - Image preprocessing pipeline (grayscale, blur, edge detection) uses memory
      - Continuous processing may not properly release allocated memory
      - Combined with existing batch processing memory pressure
    mitigation_required:
      - Memory Management - Explicit cleanup of OpenCV Mat objects
      - Memory Monitoring - Track memory usage during edge detection sessions
      - Resource Pooling - Reuse OpenCV objects where possible
      - Memory Budgets - Set strict limits on edge detection memory usage (<10MB target)
      - Integration Testing - Validate with Story 1.1 batch processing scenarios
    testing_focus:
      - Memory leak detection during extended edge detection sessions
      - Memory usage in combination with batch processing
      - Garbage collection efficiency with OpenCV operations
      - Peak memory usage profiling
    ac_impact: Could compound Story 1.1 memory issues, affecting overall app stability
