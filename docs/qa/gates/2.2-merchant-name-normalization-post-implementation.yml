review_notes: |
  Post-implementation review shows exceptional quality:
  - All acceptance criteria fully implemented
  - Comprehensive test coverage across all levels
  - Performance targets not just met but exceeded
  - Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Thoughtful UI/UX with normalization indicators
  - No refactoring needed - code quality excellent from start
  
  Developer effectively applied all pre-development QA recommendations,
  resulting in a high-quality implementation ready for production.
