DOCUMENT_METADATA:
  type: "architecture_section"
  parent_document: "Receipt Organizer MVP - Fullstack Architecture Document"
  section_number: 1
  version: "1.0"
  last_updated: "2025-01-05"
  author: "Winston (Architect)"
  status: "Complete"

SECTION_PURPOSE:
  primary: "Document context and architectural goals"
  scope: "Complete fullstack architecture overview"
  audience: "AI-driven development teams"
  integration_approach: "Unified frontend/backend documentation"
```

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Receipt Organizer MVP, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.
