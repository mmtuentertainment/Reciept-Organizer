## Epic Description {
  Vision: |
    Create a robust production infrastructure that securely hosts the Receipt Organizer application,
    ensuring data integrity, proper authentication, and scalability for growing user base.

  Scope: [
    "Pre-production validation and backup procedures",
    "Supabase cloud project creation and configuration",
    "Database migration from local to production",
    "Security hardening and verification",

  ]

  Success_Metrics: {
    technical: [
      "100% migrations applied successfully",
      "All tables have RLS enabled",
      "Zero unauthorized data access",
      "Backup and rollback procedures tested"
    ],
    operational: [
      "< 60 minute total deployment time",
      "Complete documentation created",
      "Security runbook available",
      "Team can access production"
    ]

      "Epic 5.4: Security Configuration (30 min)",
      "Final verification"
    ]

    Total_Duration: "2.5 hours active work + buffer time"
  }

  ### Rollback_Points: [
    "After backup creation",
