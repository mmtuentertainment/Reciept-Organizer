  <epic-goal>
    Create a seamless photo-to-data pipeline that enables users to quickly capture receipts with automatic edge detection, extract key data fields using OCR with confidence scoring, and handle capture failures gracefully.
  </epic-goal>

  <epic-description>
    <vision>
      Enable mom-and-pop business owners to transform physical receipts into structured digital data with minimal friction, providing transparency about OCR accuracy and allowing quick corrections when needed.

    <scope>
      - Batch receipt capture mode for processing multiple receipts
      - Automatic edge detection with manual override capability
      - OCR extraction of 4 core fields: merchant, date, total, tax

      - Retry mechanism for failed captures
    </scope>
    
    <success-metrics>
      - Batch capture: 10 receipts in &lt;3 minutes
      - Edge detection: 80%+ success rate on standard receipts
      - OCR processing: &lt;5s per receipt
      - Confidence scoring: Visual indicators for all fields
      - Retry flow: Immediate availability after failures
