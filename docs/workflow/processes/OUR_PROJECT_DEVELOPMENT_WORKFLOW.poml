## üèÅ Conclusion {
  @summary: "This document represents our complete development journey building the Receipt Organizer together"

  What_We_Built: {
    Achievement: "Multi-platform receipt management system",
    Progress: "60% complete, production infrastructure ready",
    Quality: "Story-driven with comprehensive QA",
    Innovation: "Simplified testing, offline-first, batch OCR"
  }

  How_We_Built_It: {
    Methodology: "BMad Framework for Brownfield",
    Collaboration: "Matt (Product) + Claude (Development)",
    Duration: "4 months (Sep 2024 - Jan 2025)",
    Artifacts: "138+ documented decisions and implementations"
  }

  Where_We_Are: {
    Current: "Phase 2, Story 2.5 Complete",
    Blockers: "Test failures, field mapping",
    Timeline: "4-6 weeks to completion"
  }

  Final_Note: """
    This workflow document captures every decision, implementation,
    and lesson from our journey together. It's not just documentation -
    it's the story of how we transformed an idea into a working system,
    one story at a time, using the BMad framework as our guide but
    making it our own along the way.
