  - id: 'PERF-001'
    severity: high
    finding: 'Large image rendering (10MB) may cause frame drops below 60 FPS target on lower-end devices'
    resolution: 'Implemented progressive loading, ImageCacheService with LRU eviction, and PerformanceMonitor. 60 FPS maintained for images up to 5MB, progressive loading ensures responsiveness for 10MB.'
  - id: 'PERF-002'
    severity: high
    finding: 'Risk of memory leaks from improper image/controller disposal in Flutter'
    resolution: 'All controllers properly disposed, ImageViewerProvider uses AutoDispose, image cache eviction on disposal, comprehensive memory leak tests included.'
  - id: 'TECH-001'
    severity: medium
    finding: 'Bounding box coordinate system mapping not fully specified'
    resolution: 'Created comprehensive ocr_coordinates.md documentation, implemented debug visualization mode, clear transformation matrix calculations.'
