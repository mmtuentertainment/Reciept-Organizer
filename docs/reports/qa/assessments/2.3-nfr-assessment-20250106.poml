overall_verdict:
  decision: "PASS WITH MINOR CONCERNS"
  
  rationale: |
    The implementation is solid with good adherence to patterns and standards.
    Performance and accessibility concerns are minor and don't block release.
    
  conditions:
    - "Document that performance test should be added before scaling"
    - "Track accessibility improvements for future sprint"
    
  risks:
    - risk: "Search performance at scale"
      likelihood: "Low"
      impact: "Medium"
      mitigation: "Monitor and implement FTS if needed"
