  nice_to_have:
    - scenario: "Performance test with 1000+ receipts"
      reason: "Mentioned in subtasks but not implemented"
      priority: "Medium"
    
    - scenario: "Concurrent edit handling"
      reason: "Multiple users editing same receipt"

  strengths:
    - "Comprehensive edge cases (null, empty, special chars)"
    - "Realistic business scenarios"
    - "Good boundary value testing"
  
  improvements:
    - "Could use more diverse character sets (Unicode)"
    - "Longer realistic notes for truncation testing"

  verdict: "PASS - Comprehensive test coverage with clear Given-When-Then patterns"
  rationale: |
    - All acceptance criteria fully covered
    - Excellent unit and integration test coverage
    - Clear test naming and structure
    - Good edge case handling
    - Minor gap in E2E testing acceptable for this feature
