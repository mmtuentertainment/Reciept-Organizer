## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 11
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2  
- Medium Risks: 5
- Low Risks: 4
- Risk Score: 69/100 (Moderate Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

No critical risks identified. This story involves well-understood technology (CSV generation) with manageable complexity.

## High Risk Areas

### 1. SEC-001: CSV Injection Vulnerability

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: High (3) - User data frequently contains special characters  
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could compromise data integrity in importing systems  
**Affected Components**:
- CSVExportService._generateQuickBooksCSV()
- CSVExportService._generateXeroCSV()
- CSVExportService._generateGenericCSV()

**Mitigation**:
- Implement comprehensive sanitization for special characters (=, +, -, @, tab, CR, LF)
- Prefix dangerous characters with single quote as per OWASP guidelines
- Add unit tests with malicious payloads
- Code review focusing on all user-generated content paths

**Testing Focus**: Security testing with injection attempts in merchant names, notes fields

### 2. DATA-001: Format Compliance Failures

**Score: 6 (High)**  
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex format requirements with date/number variations  
**Impact**: High (3) - Failed imports would severely impact user workflow  
**Affected Components**:
- Date formatting logic (MM/dd/yyyy vs dd/MM/yyyy)
- Amount formatting (decimal places, currency symbols)
- Required field mappings

**Mitigation**:
- Create comprehensive test suites with actual QuickBooks/Xero sample data
- Implement strict validation before export
- Add integration tests that attempt actual imports (manual verification)
- Document any format deviations discovered during testing

**Testing Focus**: Format validation with edge cases, actual import testing

- Technical: 2 risks (0 high)
- Operational: 0 risks

### By Component
- Frontend: 3 risks
- Backend: 6 risks
- Database: 1 risk
- Infrastructure: 1 risk

| TECH-002 | Integration with existing ExportScreen | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| BUS-002 | Incorrect format selection persists | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low |
| PERF-001 | Large CSV generation performance | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |
| BUS-003 | Accessibility compliance gaps | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal |

## Risk Mitigation Details

### TECH-001: State Management Complexity (Medium)
**Strategy**: Preventive  
**Actions**:
- Follow established Riverpod patterns from Story 3.9
- Create clear separation between format selection and export state
- Add comprehensive provider tests
- Document state flow in code comments
**Testing**: Unit tests for all state transitions

### DATA-002: Settings Migration Data Corruption (Medium)
**Strategy**: Preventive  
**Actions**:
- Implement defensive null checks
- Default to ExportFormat.generic for any invalid data
- Add migration unit tests
- Log migration actions for debugging
**Testing**: Unit tests with various corrupted settings scenarios

### SEC-002: File System Permission Issues (Medium)
**Strategy**: Detective  
**Actions**:
- Validate export directory permissions before write
- Provide clear error messages for permission failures
- Use SecurityManager.isValidPath() for all paths
- Implement fallback to default export location
**Testing**: Integration tests with restricted permissions

### BUS-001: User Confusion Between Formats (Medium)
**Strategy**: Preventive  
**Actions**:
- Add clear format descriptions in UI
- Show example output for each format
- Include help tooltips
- Visual preview of format differences
**Testing**: Usability testing with actual bookkeepers

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- CSV injection security tests with malicious payloads
- Format compliance validation with real QuickBooks/Xero data
- End-to-end export and import verification

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests  
- State management edge cases and race conditions
- Settings migration with corrupted data
- File permission error handling
- User interface clarity testing

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Character encoding edge cases
- Performance with large datasets (1000+ receipts)
- Accessibility compliance verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All CSV injection vulnerabilities
- Core format compliance for QuickBooks/Xero
- Critical accessibility requirements (keyboard navigation)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Minor format variations with documented workarounds
- Performance optimization for very large exports
- Enhanced error messaging for permissions

### Accepted Risks
- Some edge case character encoding issues (document workarounds)
- Minor UI polish items

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Export success/failure rates by format
- CSV generation performance metrics
- User format selection patterns
- Error rates for permission issues

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- QuickBooks/Xero update their import requirements
- New export formats are requested
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in CSV handling
- User feedback indicates confusion or failures
