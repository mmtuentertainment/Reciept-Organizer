    title: "Original Merchant Value Loss"
    probability: 3  # High - Common during normalization
    impact: 2      # Medium - Recoverable but impacts audit trail
    score: 6
    description: |
      Normalization could permanently overwrite original OCR values if not properly 
      preserved, losing audit trail and rollback capability required by AC.
    mitigation:
      - "Ensure ProcessingResult.merchant.originalValue is always preserved"
      - "Implement database schema to store both original and normalized values"
      - "Add validation to prevent original value overwrites"
      - "Create automated tests verifying original value preservation"
    testing_focus:
      - "Original value preservation across all normalization patterns"

    score: 6
    description: |
      Complex normalization rules or inefficient pattern matching could push OCR 
      processing time beyond the 5-second target, degrading user experience.
    mitigation:
      - "Use efficient string operations over regex where possible"
      - "Implement caching for common merchant patterns"
      - "Lazy load merchant dictionary on first use"
      - "Add performance benchmarks to CI pipeline"

    description: |
      Aggressive normalization patterns might incorrectly modify valid merchant 
      names, e.g., "7-Eleven" becoming "Seven-Eleven" or "H&M" becoming "H and M".
    mitigation:
