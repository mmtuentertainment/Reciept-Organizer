**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Despite Story 3.11 protections, new validation logic may introduce gaps
**Impact**: High (3) - Remote code execution in spreadsheet applications
**Mitigation**:
- Leverage existing CSV injection prevention from Story 3.11

### 6. DATA-002: Data Loss During Validation Crash

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex validation logic may fail
**Impact**: High (3) - User loses export progress
**Mitigation**:
