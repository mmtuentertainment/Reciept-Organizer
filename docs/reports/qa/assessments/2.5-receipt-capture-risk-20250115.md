## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Camera Plugin Integration Complexity
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Camera plugins frequently have platform-specific issues
**Impact**: High (3) - Core feature won't work without camera
**Mitigation**:
- Test on multiple device models (Android 10+, iOS 13+)
- Implement fallback to image picker if camera fails
- Add comprehensive error handling for permission denials
**Testing Focus**: Device-specific integration tests, permission edge cases

### 2. DATA-001: Receipt Image Storage Without Encryption
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Images stored in plain format per current design
**Impact**: High (3) - Sensitive financial data exposed if device compromised
**Mitigation**:
- Implement AES-256 encryption for stored images
- Use flutter_secure_storage for encryption keys

**Impact**: High (3) - Poor UX if processing takes >5s
**Mitigation**:
- Implement image preprocessing to reduce size before OCR
- Add progress indicators with cancel option
- Consider cloud OCR fallback for complex receipts
**Testing Focus**: Performance testing on minimum spec devices

### 4. TECH-002: Edge Detection Library Reliability
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Edge detection can fail in poor lighting
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Manual cropping fallback needed
**Mitigation**:
- Implement manual crop option
- Add lighting guidance UI
- Test in various lighting conditions
**Testing Focus**: Environmental condition testing

### 5. DATA-002: Orphaned Image Files After Failed Processing
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Crashes during processing leave files
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Storage bloat over time
**Mitigation**:
- Implement cleanup service on app startup
- Add transaction-like processing with rollback
- Monitor storage usage
**Testing Focus**: Crash recovery testing, storage management

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Camera Integration Tests**
  - Test on 5+ different Android devices
  - Test on 3+ iPhone models
  - Permission denial scenarios
  - Camera unavailable scenarios

- **Security Tests**
  - Verify image encryption implementation
  - Test data protection when app backgrounded
  - Validate secure storage usage

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Performance Tests**
  - OCR processing on minimum spec devices (2GB RAM)
  - Batch capture memory usage monitoring
  - Image compression benchmarks

- **Edge Detection Tests**
  - Low light conditions
  - Wrinkled receipts
  - Different receipt sizes
  - Manual override functionality

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Standard functional tests for happy path
- UI responsiveness tests
- Error message validation
- Accessibility testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- TECH-001: Camera integration must work on 95% of devices
- DATA-001: Image encryption must be implemented
- PERF-001: OCR must complete in <5s on target devices

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- TECH-002: Manual crop fallback acceptable
- DATA-002: Cleanup service implementation
- TECH-003: Clear permission request messaging

### Accepted Risks
- TECH-005: Document batch size limitations
- DATA-003: Regenerate thumbnails on demand if missing

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Camera initialization failure rates
- OCR processing times by device type
- Storage usage growth patterns
- Permission denial rates
- Edge detection success rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Camera or edge detection library updates
- New device OS versions released
- OCR accuracy complaints increase
- Security vulnerabilities discovered
- Performance issues reported

## Brownfield-Specific Considerations

### Integration Risks with Existing System
1. **Database Schema Compatibility**: New Receipt model must align with existing auth tables
2. **State Management Conflicts**: Riverpod providers must not conflict with auth providers
3. **Navigation Flow**: Camera capture must integrate with existing navigation
4. **Storage Conflicts**: Image storage must not interfere with existing Supabase storage

### Regression Risk Areas
1. **Authentication Flow**: Ensure camera permissions don't break auth
2. **Existing Receipt Features**: Stories 2.1-2.4 depend on receipt structure
3. **Export Functionality**: Story 3.12 validation depends on receipt data

### Technical Debt Considerations
1. **15-Test Limit**: Must carefully select which tests to add
2. **Package Conflicts**: Camera/OCR packages may conflict with existing
3. **Performance Budget**: OCR processing adds to app resource usage
