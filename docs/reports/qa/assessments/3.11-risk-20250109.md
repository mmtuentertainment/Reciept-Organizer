Date: 2025-01-09
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Medium Risks: 3
- Low Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 57/100 (Moderate-High Risk)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: CSV Injection Vulnerability

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - User-entered receipt data frequently contains special characters that could be interpreted as formulas when opened in spreadsheet applications
**Impact**: High - Successful CSV injection could execute arbitrary formulas, access local files, or exfiltrate data when the CSV is opened
**Mitigation**:
- Implement comprehensive sanitization for all CSV special characters (=, +, -, @, tab, CR, LF)
- Use established CSV sanitization library or proven patterns
- Apply sanitization at the service layer before any CSV generation
- Add comprehensive security tests covering OWASP injection patterns
**Testing Focus**: Security test suite with injection attempts, penetration testing, automated security scanning

## High Risks

### 2. PERF-001: Preview Generation Exceeding 100ms Target

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Processing multiple receipts with validation requires significant computation
**Impact**: Medium - User experience degradation, perceived slowness
**Mitigation**:
- Implement lazy loading - only fully process first 5 receipts
- Use memoization for repeated calculations
- Add performance monitoring and alerts
- Consider using web workers for heavy processing
**Testing Focus**: Performance tests with varying data sizes, load testing with concurrent users

### 3. DATA-001: Preview-Export Mismatch

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Different code paths between preview and export could diverge
**Impact**: High - Users lose trust if what they preview differs from exported file
**Mitigation**:
- Share exact same CSV generation logic between preview and export
- Create single source of truth service for CSV formatting
- Add automated tests comparing preview to export output
- Implement checksums to verify consistency
**Testing Focus**: Integration tests comparing preview and export, regression tests for format changes

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- **Security Testing Suite**
  - CSV injection test cases with all special characters
  - Formula injection attempts (=cmd|'/c calc', =1+1, @SUM)
  - Penetration testing of CSV generation endpoints
  - Automated security scanning with OWASP ZAP

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- **Performance Testing**
  - Load tests with 100+ receipts
  - Measure preview generation time
  - Concurrent user testing
  - Memory profiling for leaks
- **Data Consistency Testing**
  - Automated comparison of preview vs export
  - Format consistency across QuickBooks/Xero/Generic
  - Edge cases (empty data, special characters)

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Integration Testing**
  - Provider dependency updates
  - State management scenarios
  - UI responsiveness testing
- **Functional Testing**
  - Standard acceptance criteria validation
  - User workflow testing
  - Error handling scenarios

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- SEC-001: CSV Injection vulnerability (Critical)
- PERF-001: Must achieve <100ms for typical use (High)
- DATA-001: Preview must match export exactly (High)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- TECH-001, TECH-002: With proper monitoring and error handling
- PERF-002: With performance monitoring alerts

### Accepted Risks
- BUS-001: Accept with clear UI documentation
- OPS-001: Accept with cache TTL configuration

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- **Performance Metrics**: Preview generation time P50/P95/P99
- **Security Alerts**: Suspicious CSV content patterns
- **Error Rates**: Preview generation failures
- **Memory Usage**: Widget disposal and provider cleanup
- **User Behavior**: Preview usage patterns and confusion indicators

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- CSV export format requirements change
- New data fields added to receipts
- Performance requirements change
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in dependencies
- User feedback indicates confusion or errors

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement comprehensive CSV sanitization before any other work
2. Set up performance monitoring infrastructure
3. Create shared CSV generation service for consistency

### Development Focus
- Security-first approach to all CSV handling
- Performance profiling from day one
- Extensive test coverage for edge cases

### Testing Priority
1. Security tests (blocking)
2. Performance tests (blocking)
3. Data consistency tests (blocking)
4. Integration tests (recommended)
5. UI/UX tests (recommended)
