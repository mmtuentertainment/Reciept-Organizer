## Threats to Validity

### **Time-and-Motion Study Limitations**

**Measurement Bias:**
- **Sample size:** Workflow timing based on limited documentation rather than controlled studies
- **User skill variance:** 5x-10x performance differences between novice/expert users
- **Context dependency:** Optimal conditions assumed (good lighting, clear receipts)

**Data Source Validity:**
- **Review correlation:** User frustration may not directly correspond to workflow inefficiency
- **Documentation accuracy:** Official tutorials may represent idealized workflows
- **Version currency:** App functionality changes rapidly

**Competitive Intelligence Gaps:**
- **Roadmap visibility:** Limited insight into competitor improvement plans
- **Performance claims:** OCR accuracy unverified by independent testing
- **Usage patterns:** Workflow optimization based on assumptions vs measured behavior

**Confidence Level:** Medium-High (70-80%) for relative rankings, Medium (60-70%) for absolute measurements

**Recommendation:** Validate through controlled 25-user time-and-motion study across all competitor apps
