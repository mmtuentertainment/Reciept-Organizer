## üîÑ Story Workflow Processes

### 1. Story Creation Process

```yaml
Trigger: New epic story needed
Actor: Scrum Master

Steps:
  1. Reference PRD:
     - Open: docs/sharded-prd/epics.poml
     - Find: Relevant epic and user story
     - Extract: Core requirements
  
  2. Create Story Document:
     - File: docs/stories/{epic}.{story}.story.md
     - Template: Use story template
     - Status: Set to "Draft"
  
  3. Define Acceptance Criteria:
     - Source: PRD acceptance criteria
     - Refine: Add technical requirements
     - Validate: Measurable and testable
  
  4. Technical Planning:
     - Review: Architecture alignment
     - Identify: Dependencies
     - Estimate: Story points
  
  5. Documentation:
     - Update: CLAUDE.md tracker
     - Link: Related stories
     - Note: Any deviations from PRD
```

### 2. Development Process

```yaml
Trigger: Story moves to "In Progress"
Actor: Developer

Steps:
  1. Story Review:
     - Read: Complete story document
     - Check: Architecture alignment
     - Clarify: Any ambiguities
  
  2. Implementation:
     - Branch: Create feature branch
     - Code: Implement requirements
     - Test: Write unit tests
  
  3. Documentation:
     - Update: Story implementation notes
     - Document: Any deviations
     - Comment: Complex code sections
  
  4. Validation:
     - Run: All tests
     - Check: Acceptance criteria
     - Review: Code quality
  
  5. Submission:
     - Push: Feature branch
     - Update: Story status to "Review"
     - Create: Pull request
```

### 3. QA Review Process

```yaml
Trigger: Story moves to "Review"
Actor: QA Engineer

Steps:
  1. Assessment Creation:
     - Risk: docs/qa/assessments/{story}-risk-{date}.md
     - Test: docs/qa/assessments/{story}-test-design-{date}.md
     - Trace: Requirements traceability
  
  2. Testing:
     - Unit: Verify test coverage
     - Integration: Test feature flows
     - Acceptance: Validate criteria
  
  3. Documentation Review:
     - Story: Implementation notes complete
     - Code: Comments adequate
     - Architecture: Alignment verified
  
  4. Decision:
     - Pass: Move to "Done"
     - Fail: Back to "In Progress"
     - Document: Issues found
```

### 4. Completion Process

```yaml
Trigger: Story passes QA review
Actor: Product Owner

Steps:
  1. Final Validation:
     - Review: QA assessments
     - Verify: Acceptance criteria
     - Check: Documentation
  
  2. Approval:
     - Status: Update to "Done/Complete"
     - Sign-off: Product owner approval
     - Merge: To main branch
  
  3. Documentation:
     - Update: CLAUDE.md tracker
     - Archive: Story document
     - Release: Add to release notes
```

## üéØ Status Transition Rules

### Valid Transitions

```yaml

  cannot_move_to: [Draft, Ready]
  
Ready:
  can_move_to: [In Progress, Blocked, Draft]
  cannot_move_to: [Review, Done]
  
In Progress:
  can_move_to: [Review, Blocked]
  cannot_move_to: [Draft, Ready, Done]
  
Done/Complete:
  can_move_to: [] # Terminal state
  cannot_move_to: [Any]

## üö® Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Story Stuck in Draft
**Symptoms**: Story remains in Draft > 5 days  
**Causes**: 
- Unclear requirements
- Missing information
- Low priority

**Solutions**:
- Schedule refinement session
- Escalate to Product Owner
- Move to backlog if not ready

### Issue: Review Cycle Loop
**Symptoms**: Story bounces between Review and In Progress repeatedly  
**Causes**:
- Unclear acceptance criteria
- Quality issues
- Scope creep

**Solutions**:
- Clarify acceptance criteria
- Pair programming session
- Split story if too large

### Issue: Extended Blocked Status
**Symptoms**: Story blocked > 2 days  
**Causes**:
- External dependencies
- Technical constraints
- Resource availability

**Solutions**:
- Escalate to Scrum Master
- Find alternative approach
- Re-prioritize if critical

## üîß Automation Opportunities

### Status Update Automation

```bash
# Git hook for automatic status updates
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/post-commit

# Update story status based on branch name
branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)
if [[ $branch == story/* ]]; then
  story_file="docs/stories/${branch#story/}.story.md"
  if [ -f "$story_file" ]; then
    # Update status to "In Progress" on first commit
    sed -i 's/## Status.*/## Status\nIn Progress/' "$story_file"
  fi
fi
```

### PR Integration

```yaml
# GitHub Action for story status
name: Update Story Status
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, closed]

jobs:
  update-story:
    steps:
      - name: Update to Review
        if: github.event.action == 'opened'
        run: |
          # Update story status to Review
          
      - name: Update to Done
        if: github.event.action == 'closed' && github.event.pull_request.merged
        run: |
          # Update story status to Done
```
