### Think-Aloud Protocol Specifications

**Evidence-Based Implementation** *(Source: 2023 TA research)*

```
PRE-TASK INSTRUCTIONS:
"Please think out loud as you work through these tasks. Tell me what you're looking for, what you're thinking, and what you expect to happen. There are no right or wrong approaches - we're learning how to make this better for people like you."

CONCURRENT PROMPTS (use sparingly - only after >10 seconds silence):
- "What are you thinking right now?"
- "What would you expect to happen next?"  
- "How does this compare to what you usually do?"

POST-TASK PROBES (for each task):
- "What was most challenging about that task?"
- "What would make this easier next time?"
- "How confident are you in the result?" (1-7 scale)
- "How does this compare to your current receipt process?"

MODERATOR BEHAVIOR GUIDELINES:
✅ Neutral, encouraging tone throughout
✅ Minimal interruption during task performance  
✅ Gentle prompts when participant silent >10 seconds
✅ Probe for specific reasoning without leading
❌ No solution suggestions or performance hints
❌ No evaluation of participant choices during tasks
❌ No rushed transitions between tasks
```

- ERROR: Incorrect action requiring correction (usability failure)
- SUCCESS: Task completion without external assistance (design success)

COGNITIVE INDICATORS:
- EXPECT: Verbal prediction of system behavior (mental model)
- CONFUSE: Expressed uncertainty or confusion (comprehension failure)  
- SATISFY: Positive reaction to system response (design validation)
