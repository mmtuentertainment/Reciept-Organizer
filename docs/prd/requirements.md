# Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR1**: The system SHALL implement Supabase Auth integration across all three platforms (Flutter web, Next.js, React Native) with consistent user experience
- **FR2**: Users SHALL be able to sign up and log in using email/password authentication with secure password requirements
- **FR3**: Users SHALL be able to authenticate using OAuth providers, starting with Google Sign-In
- **FR4**: The system SHALL maintain user sessions with automatic token refresh before expiration
- **FR5**: Users SHALL be able to manage their profile information including username, full name, website, and avatar
- **FR6**: The system SHALL support profile photo upload to Supabase Storage with automatic thumbnail generation
- **FR7**: Each authenticated user SHALL only access their own receipts via Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- **FR8**: The mobile app SHALL support offline authentication with cached credentials and sync when online
- **FR9**: Users SHALL be able to sign out from any platform, invalidating their session across all devices
- **FR10**: The system SHALL provide password reset functionality via email magic links
- **FR11**: Session state SHALL be synchronized across browser tabs in web applications
- **FR12**: The system SHALL track and display user authentication status in the UI
- **FR13**: The system SHALL remember user login state across app restarts using platform-specific secure storage (Keychain for iOS, Keystore for Android, secure cookies for web)
- **FR14**: The system SHALL support biometric authentication (fingerprint/face) on mobile devices as a convenience feature after initial password authentication
- **FR15**: The system SHALL automatically log out inactive users after configured timeout periods (30 minutes for web, 2 hours for mobile)

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR1**: Authentication responses SHALL complete within 2 seconds under normal network conditions
- **NFR2**: The system SHALL handle up to 1000 concurrent authenticated users without degradation
- **NFR3**: Passwords SHALL be hashed using bcrypt with a minimum cost factor of 10
- **NFR4**: JWT tokens SHALL expire after 1 hour with refresh tokens valid for 7 days
- **NFR5**: The system SHALL log all authentication attempts for security auditing via MCP monitoring
- **NFR6**: OAuth integrations SHALL use PKCE flow for enhanced security
- **NFR7**: The system SHALL maintain 99.9% availability for authentication services
- **NFR8**: Profile images SHALL be limited to 5MB with supported formats: JPG, PNG, WebP
- **NFR9**: The system SHALL comply with GDPR requirements for user data handling
- **NFR10**: Authentication errors SHALL provide user-friendly messages without exposing system details
- **NFR11**: Authentication state changes SHALL be reflected in the UI within 100ms to provide immediate user feedback
- **NFR12**: Biometric authentication SHALL fall back gracefully to password entry if biometric fails or is unavailable
- **NFR13**: Session timeout warnings SHALL be dismissible to extend the session for another timeout period

### Compatibility Requirements

- **CR1**: Existing API Compatibility - All current receipt endpoints SHALL continue functioning with added auth headers
- **CR2**: Database Schema Compatibility - New auth tables SHALL not modify existing receipt schema, only extend via foreign keys
- **CR3**: UI/UX Consistency - Auth UI SHALL use existing design system (shadcn for web, Material for Flutter)
- **CR4**: Integration Compatibility - Google Vision API calls SHALL include user context for quota tracking per user
- **CR5**: Storage Compatibility - Existing receipt images SHALL be migrated to user-specific storage buckets
- **CR6**: Test Suite Compatibility - Authentication SHALL not break the existing 15 critical tests
