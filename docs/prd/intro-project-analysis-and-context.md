# Intro Project Analysis and Context

### Existing Project Overview

#### Analysis Source
- Document-project output available at: `/home/matt/FINAPP/Receipt Organizer/docs/brownfield-architecture.md`
- IDE-based fresh analysis with MCP server capabilities

#### Current Project State

The Receipt Organizer is a multi-platform receipt management system for mom-and-pop businesses (100-500 receipts/month). Phase 1 (Database Foundation & Storage) is complete with production Supabase infrastructure deployed. The system provides offline-first receipt capture, OCR processing, and CSV export across three platforms: Flutter (mobile/web), Next.js (web), and React Native (native mobile).

### Available Documentation Analysis

Using existing project analysis from document-project output:

**Available Documentation** ✓
- Tech Stack Documentation ✓ (from brownfield-architecture.md)
- Source Tree/Architecture ✓ (comprehensive monorepo structure documented)
- Coding Standards ✓ (platform-specific patterns identified)
- API Documentation ✓ (Supabase REST/GraphQL documented)
- External API Documentation ✓ (Google Vision API, MCP servers)
- Technical Debt Documentation ✓ (critical gaps identified)
- UX/UI Guidelines ⚠️ (shadcn for web, custom for mobile)

### Enhancement Scope Definition

#### Enhancement Type
✓ **Major Feature Modification** - Adding comprehensive authentication system
✓ **Integration with New Systems** - Supabase Auth across all platforms
✓ **Technology Stack Upgrade** - Implementing OAuth, session management

#### Enhancement Description
Implement Phase 2 Authentication & User Management across all three platforms (Flutter, Next.js, React Native), integrating Supabase Auth with email/password, OAuth (Google), session management, and user profiles while maintaining offline-first architecture.

#### Impact Assessment
✓ **Significant Impact** - Substantial existing code changes required across all platforms, new auth flows, session management, and user profile features

### Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
- Enable secure multi-user access with Supabase Auth integration
- Implement consistent authentication across Flutter, Next.js, and React Native
- Support email/password and OAuth (Google) authentication methods
- Provide offline-capable session management with automatic token refresh
- Create user profile management with avatar upload capability
- Leverage MCP servers for rapid development and testing

#### Background Context
With Phase 1's database and storage infrastructure complete, the system needs authentication to support multiple users and secure data isolation. Currently, the web app has basic Supabase auth working, mobile has disconnected auth implementation, and native has no auth at all. This enhancement will unify authentication across all platforms using Supabase Auth, enabling the system to support real business users with proper data isolation and security.
