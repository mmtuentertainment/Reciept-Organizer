    <market-gaps>
      <gap name="Simple Small Business Focus">
        <description>
          Most solutions target enterprises or require complex setup.
          Gap exists for simple, honest receipt digitization.
        </description>
        <our-solution>
          Mobile-first app focused solely on receipts with one-time purchase model.
        </our-solution>
      </gap>

      <gap name="Offline-First Design">
        <description>
          Existing solutions require internet connectivity for core functions.
          Small businesses need to work during busy periods without connectivity.
        </description>
        <our-solution>
          Complete offline functionality with sync when online returns.
        </our-solution>
      </gap>

      <gap name="No Subscription Fees">
        <description>
          All major competitors use subscription models that add up over time.
          Small businesses prefer one-time purchases.
        </description>
        <our-solution>
          One-time purchase model with optional cloud storage subscription.
        </our-solution>
      </gap>

      <gap name="Mobile-First Experience">
        <description>
          Most solutions are desktop-first with poor mobile experiences.
          Receipt capture is inherently a mobile activity.
        </description>
