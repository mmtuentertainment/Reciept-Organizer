# Phase 3: Queue Mechanism - Baseline Measurement

## Date: 2025-09-10

### Current State Documentation

#### Failed Request Handling: NONE
- API calls fail immediately when offline
- No retry mechanism exists
- User loses work if request fails
- Must manually retry operations

#### Current Failure Patterns

1. **QuickBooks Validation**
   - Returns error immediately when offline
   - User must remember to retry later
   - No persistence of validation attempt
   
2. **Xero Export**
   - Throws exception on network failure
   - No queue for batch operations
   - Lost exports if connection drops mid-process

3. **OAuth Callbacks**
   - Fail silently if network issues
   - No retry for token refresh
   - User must re-authenticate

#### User Impact of Current Behavior
- **Data Loss**: Failed exports are not saved
- **Manual Tracking**: User must remember what failed
- **Poor UX**: Technical error messages
- **No Recovery**: Must restart entire process

#### Technical Limitations
- No request serialization
- No persistence layer for failed operations
- No retry logic or exponential backoff
- No conflict resolution

### Hypothesis for Phase 3.2
"We can create a lightweight queue mechanism using SQLite that persists failed requests with minimal overhead and automatic retry capability"

### Success Criteria
1. Failed requests are persisted to database
2. Queue processes automatically when connectivity restored
3. Successful requests are removed from queue
4. Failed retries use exponential backoff
5. Queue size is limited to prevent unbounded growth
6. Performance impact <50ms per request

### Measurement Plan
- Queue entry creation time
- Database size growth
- Retry success rate
- Time to process queue
- Memory usage with queue
