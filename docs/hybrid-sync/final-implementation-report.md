## Architecture Evolution

### Before Implementation
```
User Action → API Call → Success/Failure
                ↓
           User Must Retry
```

### After Implementation
```
User Action → Connectivity Check → Online → API Call → Success
                    ↓
                Offline → Queue → Background Sync → Auto-Retry → Success
                    ↓
            User Notification
```
