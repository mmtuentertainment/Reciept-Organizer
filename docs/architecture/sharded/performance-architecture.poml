# Performance Architecture



### Performance Targets
critical_metrics:
  - metric: "Initial app load"
    target: "< 100ms"
    critical: "< 200ms"
    measure: "Time to first meaningful paint"

  - metric: "Authentication"
    target: "< 1s"
    critical: "< 2s"
    measure: "Login button click to home screen"

  - metric: "Receipt capture to OCR"
    target: "< 5s"
    critical: "< 8s"
    measure: "Shutter click to extracted data display"

  - metric: "Token refresh"
    target: "< 500ms"
    critical: "< 1s"
    measure: "Background operation time"

  - metric: "Database query"
    target: "< 50ms"
    critical: "< 100ms"
    measure: "Query execution time"

### Optimization Strategies
frontend:
  flutter:
    - "Const widgets where possible"
    - "Widget key optimization"
    - "Image caching with CachedNetworkImage"
    - "Lazy loading lists with ListView.builder"
    - "Code splitting by feature"

  nextjs:
    - "Static generation where possible"
    - "Dynamic imports for code splitting"
    - "Image optimization with next/image"
    - "API routes for backend operations"
    - "Edge functions for auth checks"

  react_native:
    - "Hermes JS engine"
    - "RAM bundles for faster startup"
    - "Image optimization with FastImage"
    - "Navigation lazy loading"

backend:
  database:
    - "Proper indexing on all foreign keys"
    - "Composite indexes for common queries"
    - "Query optimization with EXPLAIN ANALYZE"
    - "Connection pooling"
    - "Read replicas for scaling"

  caching:
    - "Redis for session storage"
    - "CDN for static assets"
    - "Database query caching"
    - "API response caching"
