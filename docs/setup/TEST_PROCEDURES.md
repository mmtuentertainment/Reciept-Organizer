# Test Procedures for Receipt Organizer

## Step 8: Complete Setup Testing

### ‚úÖ Database Connection Test

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.receipts;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.user_profiles;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.export_batches;
```

**Expected**: All queries should return 0 or more without errors.

### ‚úÖ Storage Buckets Test

1. Go to **Storage** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Verify these buckets exist:
   - `receipts`
   - `thumbnails`
   - `exports`
3. Try uploading a test image to `receipts` bucket
4. Verify RLS policies by checking permissions

### üîÑ Authentication Test

**Prerequisites**: Configure auth providers in Supabase Dashboard first

1. **Test Sign Up**:
   ```bash
   cd apps/mobile
   flutter run
   ```
   - Navigate to Sign Up screen
   - Create account with valid email
   - Check for confirmation email
   - Verify user appears in Supabase Dashboard

2. **Test Sign In**:
   - Use confirmed account credentials
   - Should navigate to home screen
   - User avatar should show in app bar

3. **Test Sign Out**:
   - Click user menu ‚Üí Sign Out
   - Should return to login screen
   - Protected routes should redirect to login

4. **Test Offline Mode**:
   - Click "Skip for now" on login screen
   - App should work without authentication
   - Sync features will be disabled

### ‚úÖ Real-time Sync Test

1. **Single Device Test**:
   - Sign in to the app
   - Check sync status indicator (cloud icon)
   - Should show "Connected to Cloud"

2. **Multi-Device Test**:
   - Run app on two devices/emulators
   - Sign in with same account on both
   - Check presence indicator shows both devices
   - Create receipt on one device
   - Should appear on other device within seconds

3. **Offline/Online Transition**:
   - Disable network on device
   - Sync indicator should show "Offline Mode"
   - Create/edit receipts
   - Re-enable network
   - Changes should sync automatically

### üîÑ API Integration Test

1. **Vercel API Health Check**:
   ```bash
   curl https://api-aft7gxurp-matthew-utts-projects-89452c41.vercel.app/api/health
   ```
   **Expected**: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`

2. **CSV Validation Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST https://api-aft7gxurp-matthew-utts-projects-89452c41.vercel.app/api/validate/csv \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"data":[{"merchant":"Test","date":"2024-01-01","total":10.99}]}'
   ```
   **Expected**: Validation result with format compatibility

3. **OAuth Status Check**:
   ```bash
   curl https://api-aft7gxurp-matthew-utts-projects-89452c41.vercel.app/api/oauth/quickbooks/status
   ```
   **Expected**: OAuth configuration status

### üì± Flutter App Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
cd apps/mobile
flutter test
```

Run specific test suites:
```bash
# Auth tests
flutter test test/features/auth/

# Real-time sync tests
flutter test test/realtime_sync_test.dart

# Integration tests
flutter test integration_test/
```

### üîç Component Testing Checklist

### üìä Performance Benchmarks

| Operation | Target | Actual |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| App startup | < 3s | TBD |
| Auth sign in | < 2s | TBD |
| Receipt sync | < 1s | TBD |
| Image upload | < 5s | TBD |
| OCR processing | < 5s | TBD |
| CSV export | < 3s | TBD |

### üêõ Known Issues

1. **Email Confirmation**: 
   - May go to spam folder
   - Workaround: Check spam or manually confirm in dashboard

2. **Real-time Sync**:
   - Initial connection may take 2-3 seconds
   - Workaround: Show loading state during connection

3. **OAuth Redirect**:
   - Deep linking not configured for mobile
   - Workaround: Use email auth for now
