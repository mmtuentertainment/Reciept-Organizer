# Story 3.13: Bulk Delete Processed Receipts

```poml
STORY_METADATA:
  epic: 3
  story_number: 13
  title: "Bulk Delete Processed Receipts"
  priority: P2
  estimation: 3 points
  persona: "Linda (Bookkeeper)"
  
REVERSE_ENGINEERING_APPROACH:
  methodology: "Working backwards from end state to entry point"
  notation: "Each section builds from the desired outcome backwards"
  rationale: "Ensures all edge cases are caught by starting with success criteria"
  
  END_STATE:
    - "Selected receipts permanently deleted from database"
    - "Associated images removed from storage"
    - "Storage space reclaimed"
    - "UI updated to reflect deletions"
    - "User confident in what was deleted"
  
  WORKING_BACKWARDS:
    step_5_end: "Deletion complete, storage freed"
    step_4_undo: "30-second undo window expired or skipped"
    step_3_confirm: "User confirmed deletion after reviewing count/details"
    step_2_select: "User selected specific receipts for deletion"
    step_1_entry: "User entered multi-select mode"
```

## Status
âœ… **COMPLETE** - Implemented on 2025-09-10

## Story
**As a** Linda (Bookkeeper),
**I want** to bulk delete processed receipts,
**so that** storage doesn't fill up with old client data

### Architecture Alignment
- **State Management**: Using Riverpod 2.4+ with AsyncNotifierProvider for bulk operations [Source: tech-stack.md#state_management]
- **Component Organization**: Following feature-based structure in `lib/features/receipts/` [Source: frontend-architecture.md#FEATURE_MODULES]
- **Repository Pattern**: All database operations through ReceiptRepository [Source: coding-standards.md#data_access]
- **Material 3**: Using Material 3 design system for all UI components [Source: tech-stack.md#ui_system]

### Testing Standards
- **Unit Tests**: All service methods must have tests [Source: coding-standards.md#CRITICAL_RULES]
- **Widget Tests**: All new widgets need widget tests
- **Integration Tests**: Full bulk delete flow test required
- **Test Locations**: Follow pattern `test/unit/`, `test/widget/`, `test/integration/`

### Previous Story Context
From Story 3.12 (Export Validation):
- Export validation sets `wasExported` flag on receipts
- This flag will be used for "exported only" filter in bulk delete
- Material 3 theming patterns established in validation dialogs

### Performance Considerations
- Batch deletions in groups of 10 to prevent UI freezing
- Use soft delete for fast operation, defer permanent deletion
- Calculate storage asynchronously to avoid blocking
- Lazy load images sizes only when needed for confirmation

### Security Notes
- No path traversal risk as using repository pattern [Source: coding-standards.md#resource_management]
- All file operations go through StorageService with validation
- Soft delete provides recovery mechanism for user errors

## Testing

### Test Requirements
- **Test Framework**: Flutter test package with mocktail for mocking
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 80% for new code
- **Test Types Required**:
  - Unit tests for all services
  - Widget tests for all new UI components  
  - Integration test for complete flow
