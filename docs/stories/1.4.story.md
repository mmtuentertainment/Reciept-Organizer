story_statement: |
  As Sarah (Restaurant Owner),
  I want to retry failed captures,
  so that blurry photos don't block my workflow.

acceptance_criteria:

  2: User can retake photo without losing current session
  3: Previous capture attempt is discarded when retrying
  4: Retry preserves any manual adjustments (edge detection)
  5: Multiple retry attempts supported without app restart

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Quality: EXCELLENT** - The retry functionality represents a comprehensive, well-architected solution with extensive test coverage and proper error handling. The implementation demonstrates mature software engineering practices with clear separation of concerns, robust state management, and user-centered design.

**Key Strengths:**
- **Comprehensive Failure Detection**: 6 failure reason types with sophisticated image quality assessment
- **Robust Session Management**: Persistent storage with automatic expiration and cleanup
- **User Experience Excellence**: Clear failure messages, actionable tips, and intuitive retry flow
- **Test Coverage**: Extensive unit, widget, and integration tests covering all critical paths
- **Architecture Alignment**: Perfect adherence to Flutter/Riverpod patterns and project structure

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `lib/domain/services/ocr_service.dart`
  - **Change**: Added missing `toJson()` and `fromJson()` methods to `ProcessingResult` and `FieldData` classes
  - **Why**: Session persistence in `RetrySessionManager` requires JSON serialization for state restoration
  - **How**: Implemented proper serialization/deserialization with null safety and type safety

- **File**: `lib/domain/services/ocr_service.dart`
  - **Change**: Added missing `dart:math` import and fixed `sqrt()` method call
  - **Why**: Compilation error preventing test execution due to missing math library
  - **How**: Imported `dart:math` and used `math.sqrt()` instead of `.sqrt()` extension

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **PASS** - Excellent adherence to Flutter conventions, Material 3 design system, and project naming patterns
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **PASS** - Perfect alignment with feature-based architecture, proper file organization

### Follow-up Review: 2025-09-11

**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)  
**Purpose**: Re-validation of test suite execution

#### Current Test Status
- ❌ **Widget Tests**: 3 failures in retry dialog and capture failed state tests
- ❌ **Integration Test**: Compilation errors preventing test execution

#### Critical Issues Found
1. **Widget Test Failures** (HIGH Priority)
   - `RetryPromptDialog`: Button state management error when no attempts remaining
   - `CaptureFailedState`: Button state error and ScrollView expectation mismatch
   - Impact: Retry UI may not function correctly in edge cases

2. **Integration Test Compilation Errors** (CRITICAL)
   - Missing `testImageData` variable
   - Mock method call issues with null safety
   - `InputImage` type assignment errors
   - Impact: End-to-end retry flow cannot be validated

#### Updated Gate Decision
**FAIL** - Critical compilation errors in integration tests and multiple widget test failures indicate the retry functionality is not production-ready despite previous assessments.

#### Action Required
1. Fix integration test compilation errors immediately
2. Resolve widget test state management issues
3. Re-run full test suite after fixes
4. Perform end-to-end validation of retry flow

**Status Update**: Story BLOCKED - Must fix test failures before moving to Done
