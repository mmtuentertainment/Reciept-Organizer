# T1.2 Mock Services Implementation Report

## Status: IN PROGRESS

### Completed Components

#### 1. MockReceiptRepository ✅
- **Location**: `lib/infrastructure/mocks/mock_receipt_repository.dart`
- **Features**:
  - Full in-memory storage with HashMap
  - Thread-safe operations
  - Soft delete support
  - Pagination and filtering
  - Real-time stream updates
  - Statistics calculation
  - Test helper methods (clear, inject, stats tracking)
- **Lines of Code**: 520+

#### 2. MockImageStorageService ✅
- **Location**: `lib/infrastructure/mocks/mock_image_storage_service.dart`
- **Features**:
  - In-memory image storage as Uint8List
  - Simulated compression for large images
  - Thumbnail generation
  - Metadata tracking
  - Mock URL generation
  - Storage limit enforcement
  - Checksum calculation
- **Lines of Code**: 480+

### Remaining Components

#### 3. MockSyncService (TODO)
- Needs to implement ISyncService
- Queue management
- Conflict simulation
- Progress streaming

#### 4. MockAuthService (TODO)
- Needs to implement IAuthService
- Session management
- Token simulation
- Permission checking

#### 5. ServiceLocator Update (TODO)
- Update to use mock implementations
- Enable mock mode configuration

### Key Implementation Decisions

1. **In-Memory Storage**: All data stored in HashMaps for fast access
2. **Statistics Tracking**: Call counts for test assertions
3. **Failure Simulation**: `shouldFailNextOperation` flag for error testing
4. **Delay Simulation**: Optional delays to simulate real-world latency
5. **Test Helpers**: Clear, inject, and stats methods for easy testing

### Testing Requirements

- Contract tests must pass for all mock implementations
- 131 failing tests should be fixed
- Performance should be < 10ms per operation

### Next Steps

1. Complete MockSyncService implementation
2. Complete MockAuthService implementation
3. Update ServiceLocator to use mocks
4. Run contract tests
5. Fix failing tests
6. Update story status to complete

### Risk Mitigation

- **Risk**: Mock behavior diverging from real implementations
- **Mitigation**: Contract tests ensure consistency
- **Risk**: Memory usage in tests with large datasets
- **Mitigation**: Clear() methods and test teardown

### Time Estimate

- MockSyncService: 2 hours
- MockAuthService: 2 hours
- ServiceLocator updates: 1 hour
- Testing and fixes: 2 hours
- **Total Remaining**: ~7 hours
