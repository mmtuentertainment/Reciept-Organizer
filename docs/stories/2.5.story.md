# Story 2.5: Receipt Capture and Preview

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Mike (Freelance Contractor),
**I want** to capture receipts using my phone camera with edge detection,
**so that** I can quickly digitize my paper receipts with proper framing

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Camera interface with live edge detection overlay
2. Auto-capture when receipt edges are detected (with manual override)
3. Preview screen showing captured image with retry option
4. Image compression and optimization for storage (target <500KB)
5. Progress indicator during OCR processing
6. Confidence scores displayed for extracted fields
7. Save to local storage with thumbnail generation
8. Batch capture mode for multiple receipts

  - [x] Create database entry with image paths and OCR results
  - [x] Use sqflite for local database persistence
  - [x] Implement cleanup for orphaned images
  - [x] Create unit tests in test/unit/core/services/receipt_storage_service_test.dart

- [x] Task 5: Add Batch Capture Mode (AC: 8)
  - [x] Create BatchCaptureProvider using Riverpod
  - [x] Implement capture queue management
  - [x] Add "Continue Capturing" option after each capture
  - [x] Display capture count indicator
  - [x] Process receipts in background queue
  - [x] Allow review of batch before final save
  - [x] Create batch capture flow tests in test/integration/batch_capture_flow_test.dart

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/sharded-architecture/core-workflows.md#capture-workflow]
- Capture workflow: capture -> OCR -> edit (if needed) -> save
- Performance target: <5s capture-to-extract p95
- Error handling: Fallback OCR engines, manual entry options

### Data Models
[Source: docs/sharded-architecture/data-models.md#receipt-entity]
```dart
class Receipt {
  String id;           // UUID
  String imageUri;     // Local file path
  String thumbnailUri; // Compressed preview
  DateTime capturedAt;
  ReceiptStatus status; // captured|processing|ready|exported|error
  ProcessingResult ocrResults;
  ReceiptMetadata metadata;
  DateTime lastModified;
  String? notes;
  bool isDeleted;
  int version;        // Optimistic locking
}
```

### Testing Requirements
[Source: docs/sharded-architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test files mirror source structure in test/ directory
- Unit tests for services and business logic
- Widget tests for UI components
- Integration tests for complete workflows
- Use mockito for mocking dependencies
- Maintain test coverage >80% for new code

### Technical Dependencies
[Source: docs/sharded-architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Flutter 3.24.0+
- Dart 3.2+
- State Management: Riverpod 2.4+
- Camera: camera ^0.10.5
- Edge Detection: edge_detection ^1.1.2
- OCR: google_mlkit_text_recognition ^0.11.0
- Image Processing: image ^4.1.3
- Storage: sqflite ^2.3.0, path_provider ^2.1.1

### Previous Story Context
- Authentication (Stories 1.1-1.4) is complete with Supabase integration
- Receipt editing features (Stories 2.1-2.4) are implemented but need capture first
- This story fills the gap for initial receipt capture functionality

## Testing

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: test/[unit|widget|integration]/features/capture/
- Use Flutter test framework with mockito for mocking
- Integration tests should use real camera plugin in test mode
- OCR tests should use fixture images from test/fixtures/receipts/
- Maintain Given-When-Then format for test descriptions
- Mock external dependencies (camera, file system, OCR service)
- Test error scenarios: permission denied, OCR failure, storage full
