dev_context:
  previous_story_insights: |
    From Story 2.1 (Edit Low-Confidence Fields):
    - Established FieldEditor components for inline editing that must work with normalized values
    - Created field update patterns in CaptureProvider that normalization must integrate with
    - Visual indicators for confidence scores that can be adapted for normalization indicators
    - Auto-save patterns that must preserve both original and normalized values
    
    From Previous Epic 1 Stories:
    - OCR processing workflow established in OcrService with clear integration points
    - ProcessingResult model structure with merchant field as FieldData
    - Performance targets of <5s for capture-to-extract workflow
    - Established patterns for feature flags and settings management
    
  architecture_context: |
    [Source: architecture/data-models.md#field_data_validation]
    Merchant Field Structure:
    - type: string with non-empty validation
    - normalization: "Basic cleaning, common abbreviations" 
    - Stored as FieldData with value, confidence, and originalValue
    - isManuallyEdited flag tracks user corrections post-normalization
    
    [Source: architecture/backend-architecture.md#service_patterns]
    Service Implementation Patterns:
    - Services use PascalCase with "Service" suffix (MerchantNormalizationService)
    - Implement as singleton with dependency injection via Riverpod
    - Use try-catch with typed exceptions for error handling
    - Follow repository pattern for any data access needs
    
    [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#ocr_processing]
    OCR Processing Integration Point:
    - Normalization occurs after field extraction, before confidence calculation
    - Must not impact <5s processing time target
    - Preserve original OCR value for audit and rollback
    
    [Source: architecture/database-schema.md#app_settings]
    Settings Storage:
    - merchant_normalization boolean flag in app_settings table
    - Feature flag: ENABLE_MERCHANT_NORMALIZATION (default: true)
    
  data_models: |
    [Source: architecture/data-models.md#processing_result_entity]
    ProcessingResult Model:
    - merchant: FieldData object containing:
      - value: string (normalized merchant name)
      - originalValue: string (raw OCR extraction)
      - confidence: number (OCR confidence, unchanged by normalization)
      - isManuallyEdited: boolean (false after normalization, true after user edit)
      - validationStatus: 'valid'|'warning'|'error'
    
    Normalization Rules Structure:
    - Pattern matching for common formats (e.g., "MERCHANT #1234" → "Merchant")
    - Case normalization (all caps → proper case)
    - Suffix removal (store numbers, location codes)
    - Common abbreviation expansion ("MCD" → "McDonald's")
    - Special character handling (remove excess punctuation)

    - lib/core/models/processing_result.dart (ensure originalValue preserved)
    - lib/features/capture/presentation/screens/preview_screen.dart (show normalized value)

    - test/integration/merchant_normalization_flow_test.dart
    
  ui_components: |
    [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md#custom_components]
    Normalization Indicator Design:
    - Small info icon next to normalized merchant names
    - Tooltip on hover/tap showing original value
    - Consistent with existing confidence indicator patterns
    - Use Material 3 design system components
    
    Settings Toggle:
    - Standard Material Switch widget in settings screen
    - Immediate effect without app restart required
    - Group with other processing-related settings
    
  performance_requirements: |
    [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#performance_standards]
    Normalization Performance:
    - Rule matching must complete in <50ms per merchant
    - No impact on overall <5s OCR processing target
    - Efficient string operations (avoid regex where possible)
    - Cache common normalization results in memory
    - Lazy load merchant dictionary on first use
    
  testing_standards: |
    [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#unit_testing]
    Test Requirements:
    - Unit tests for all normalization patterns in Given-When-Then format
    - Test common merchant variations (McDonald's, Starbucks, Walmart, etc.)
    - Edge cases: empty strings, special characters, very long names
    - Performance tests ensuring <50ms execution time
    - Integration tests with OCR flow
    - Mock MerchantNormalizationService for OCR service tests
    
    Test Organization:
    - test/unit/services/merchant_normalization_service_test.dart
    - Follow 90%+ code coverage target
    - Use mockito for dependencies
    
  project_structure_notes: |
    Perfect alignment with established architecture. Merchant normalization fits cleanly
    as a new service in the core layer, following established patterns. Integration with
    OCR service is straightforward at the designated workflow point. No architectural
    conflicts or structural changes required. Feature flag pattern already established
    for similar functionality.
