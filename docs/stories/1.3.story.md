story_number: 3

story_statement: |
  As Linda (Bookkeeper),
  I want to see OCR confidence scores for each extracted field,

acceptance_criteria:
  1: Color-coded scores visible for each field
  2: Confidence percentages displayed (0-100%)
  3: Low confidence fields highlighted for attention (<75%)
  4: High confidence fields clearly marked as reliable (>85%)
  5: Visual indicators differentiate between confidence levels
  6: Confidence scores update in real-time during editing
