# Story 3.10: CSV Format Options

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Linda (Bookkeeper),
**I want** CSV format options,
**so that** I can match each client's system

## Acceptance Criteria
1. QuickBooks & Xero templates included
2. Format selection dropdown/radio buttons
3. Format persistence in app settings

_Note: These acceptance criteria expand on the single-line AC from the epic to provide clearer implementation guidance while maintaining the same core requirement._

### Data Models
- ExportFormat enum already exists in CSVExportService: quickbooks, xero, generic [Source: Found in codebase]
- QuickBooks format requirements: ["Date", "Amount", "Vendor", "Account"] with MM/dd/yyyy date format [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- Xero format requirements: ["Date", "Amount", "Reference", "Description"] with dd/MM/yyyy date format [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- Generic format requirements: ["Date", "Total", "Merchant", "Tax"] with YYYY-MM-DD date format [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- All formats use UTF-8 encoding and "0.00" amount format [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- Existing ValidationResult and ExportResult classes for handling export outcomes [Source: Found in codebase]

### API Specifications
- No external API calls required for this feature
- All format templates are locally defined in CSVExportService
- Export validation and generation are performed locally

### Component Specifications
- Export Feature Components: ExportSettings widget planned for export configuration [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
- Use Material 3 SegmentedButton for format selection (similar to date range preset options) [Source: architecture/frontend-architecture.md]
- Follow established Riverpod patterns with StateNotifier and AutoDispose [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Existing CSVExportService has format-specific generation methods: _generateQuickBooksCSV, _generateXeroCSV, _generateGenericCSV [Source: Found in codebase]

### File Locations
Based on project structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md and actual file system]:
- Format selection widget: apps/mobile/lib/features/export/presentation/widgets/format_selection.dart
- Format provider: apps/mobile/lib/features/export/presentation/providers/export_format_provider.dart
- Export screen updates: apps/mobile/lib/features/export/presentation/pages/export_screen.dart
- Settings updates: apps/mobile/lib/data/models/app_settings.dart
- Widget tests: apps/mobile/test/widget/features/export/
- Unit tests: apps/mobile/test/unit/features/export/

### Technical Constraints
- Flutter 3.24+ required for Material 3 components [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Riverpod 2.4+ for state management [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- CSV package 5.0+ for generation (already in use) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Validation must ensure 100% format compatibility with QuickBooks/Xero [Source: architecture/core-workflows.md]
- Character encoding must be UTF-8 for all formats [Source: architecture/data-models.md]
- Follow immutable state pattern with copyWith methods [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Security Considerations
- CSV Injection Prevention: Sanitize all user-generated content before CSV export
- Special characters to escape: =, +, -, @, tab, CR, LF (prefix with single quote)
- File System Permissions: Ensure proper permissions for export directory
- No sensitive data exposure in export file names or paths
- Validate all file paths through SecurityManager.isValidPath()

### Accessibility Requirements
- Format selector must support keyboard navigation (Tab, Arrow keys)
- All format options must have descriptive labels for screen readers
- Selected format must be announced to screen readers
- Visual feedback for format selection must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios
- Format descriptions must be accessible via aria-describedby

### Testing Requirements
From architecture standards [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md and architecture/testing-strategy.md]:
- Widget tests with 90%+ coverage target
- Use Given-When-Then pattern for test structure
- Test file location: apps/mobile/test/widget/features/export/ for UI tests
- Test file location: apps/mobile/test/unit/features/export/ for logic tests
- Mock repositories using Mockito as per existing patterns
- Test format-specific CSV generation for compliance
- Verify settings persistence across app restarts
- Test CSV injection prevention with malicious inputs
- Test accessibility compliance with keyboard and screen reader

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Summary
Story is well-prepared with comprehensive security and accessibility considerations added. The primary concern is the CSV injection vulnerability which requires careful implementation and thorough testing. Format compliance with QuickBooks/Xero must be verified with actual imports during development.

### Key Findings
1. **Security Risk (High)**: CSV injection vulnerability requires comprehensive sanitization of all user-generated content
2. **Data Risk (Medium)**: Format compliance needs verification with actual QuickBooks/Xero imports
3. **Test Gap (Medium)**: File system permission testing requires manual verification

### Risk Assessment
- Total Risks: 11 (0 Critical, 2 High, 5 Medium, 4 Low)
- Risk Score: 69/100 (Moderate Risk)
- Primary concerns: CSV injection and format compliance

### Test Coverage
- 28 test scenarios designed (12 P0, 11 P1, 5 P2)
- Strong unit test coverage (54%) for format validation
- Security testing prioritized for injection prevention
- All acceptance criteria have comprehensive coverage

### Recommendations
1. Implement CSV injection prevention as the first priority
2. Create test files from actual QuickBooks/Xero exports
3. Plan manual verification session for imports
4. Document file system permission requirements
