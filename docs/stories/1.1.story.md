# Story 1.1: Batch Receipt Capture

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As a** Sarah (Restaurant Owner),  
**I want** to capture multiple receipts quickly in batch mode,  
**so that** I can process a stack of receipts during downtime in less than 3 minutes for 10 receipts.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Batch mode captures 10 receipts in <3min
2. Long-press capture button activates batch mode
3. Auto-advance after each capture without preview
4. Running count overlay shows progress
5. Bulk review screen displays all captured receipts
6. Quick-edit capability for low confidence fields
7. Single CSV export for entire batch

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story (1.1) - no previous context available.

### Architecture Context
[Source: architecture.poml#high_level_architecture]
- **Platform**: Flutter 3.24+ cross-platform mobile application
- **Architecture Pattern**: Clean Architecture with offline-first design
- **State Management**: Riverpod 2.4+ with code generation for type safety
- **Camera Integration**: camera_2 package for Flutter with receipt-optimized settings

### Data Models
[Source: architecture.poml#data_models]
- **Receipt Model**: Core entity with `id`, `imageUri`, `thumbnailUri`, `capturedAt`, `status`, `ocrResults`
- **ProcessingResult**: Contains OCR-extracted data for 4 fields (merchant, date, total, tax) with confidence scores
- **ReceiptStatus**: Enum values include 'captured', 'processing', 'ready', 'exported', 'error'
- **ExportBatch**: Represents collection of receipts exported together as CSV

### Camera Service Interface
[Source: architecture.poml#api_specification]
- **ICameraService.captureReceipt()**: Returns `Future<CaptureResult>` for receipt photo with edge detection
- **ICameraService.initialize()**: Required before batch operations
- **ICameraService.getPreviewStream()**: Returns `Stream<CameraFrame>` for continuous preview
- **ICameraService.dispose()**: Must be called to release camera resources

### Storage Service Interface
[Source: architecture.poml#api_specification]
- **IStorageService.saveReceipt()**: Returns `Future<Receipt>` after persisting to RxDB/SQLite
- **IStorageService.queryReceipts()**: Returns `Stream<List<Receipt>>` for reactive UI updates
- **Database Schema**: `receipts` table with denormalized OCR results for performance

### File Locations
[Source: architecture.poml#project_structure]
- **Main App**: `apps/mobile/lib/` 
- **Core Logic**: `apps/mobile/lib/core/`
- **Domain Models**: `apps/mobile/lib/domain/`
- **Presentation**: `apps/mobile/lib/presentation/`
- **Infrastructure**: `apps/mobile/lib/infrastructure/`

### UI Component Specifications
[Source: front-end-spec.poml#component-library-design-system]
- **Base Framework**: shadcn/ui component library with Flutter adaptations
- **Capture Button**: Large circular button with animated states (idle, pressed, processing, success)
- **Batch Progress Indicator**: Progress bar with current/total count and time estimate
- **Receipt Card**: Displays thumbnail, 4 fields, confidence scores, and status

### Performance Requirements  
[Source: front-end-spec.poml#user-flows]
- **Batch Capture Target**: 10 receipts in <3min (18s per receipt average)
- **Individual Capture**: 2s capture + 5s OCR processing + auto-advance
- **Memory Budget**: <75MB peak usage during batch operations
- **Camera Ready Time**: <2s from batch mode activation

### Export Service Integration
[Source: architecture.poml#api_specification]
- **IExportService.exportToFile()**: Handles batch export with `List<String> receiptIds`
- **CSV Formats**: QuickBooks and Xero templates supported  
- **Validation**: Pre-export validation with `ValidationResult` feedback

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture.poml#testing_strategy]
- **Test Organization**: `test/` directory with `unit/`, `widget/`, `integration/` subdirectories
- **Widget Tests**: Required for all new UI components using `flutter_test`
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end batch capture flow testing required
- **Performance Tests**: Memory usage and timing benchmarks for batch operations
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% coverage for business logic components

## QA Results
*Results from QA Agent review of the completed story implementation*

### Review Date: 2025-09-11
**Reviewer**: Quinn (Test Architect)
**Gate Decision**: CONCERNS

### Test Execution Summary
- **Widget Tests**: ✅ 10/10 passing (`batch_capture_screen_test.dart`)
- **Unit Tests**: ❌ 7/10 passing, 3 failures (`batch_capture_notifier_test.dart`)

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Batch ID Reset Failure** (MEDIUM)
   - `stopBatchMode()` not properly clearing batch ID
   - `clearBatch()` not properly resetting batch ID to null
   - Impact: Memory leak potential, state inconsistency

2. **Receipt Reordering Logic** (LOW)
   - `reorderReceipts()` producing incorrect order
   - Impact: User experience issue when organizing batch

### Acceptance Criteria Validation
- ✅ AC1: Batch mode captures 10 receipts in <3min (widget tests confirm)
- ✅ AC2: Long-press capture button activates batch mode  
- ✅ AC3: Auto-advance after each capture
- ✅ AC4: Running count overlay shows progress
- ✅ AC5: Bulk review screen displays receipts
- ⚠️ AC6: Quick-edit capability (not directly tested)
- ✅ AC7: Single CSV export for batch

### Recommendations
**MUST FIX before Done:**
1. Fix batch ID reset in `stopBatchMode()` and `clearBatch()` methods
2. Correct receipt reordering logic in `reorderReceipts()`
3. Ensure all unit tests pass

**Gate Status**: CONCERNS - Story cannot move to Done until unit test failures are resolved

### Next Steps
1. Developer to fix the 3 failing unit tests
2. Re-run full test suite after fixes
3. Update status to Done once all tests pass
